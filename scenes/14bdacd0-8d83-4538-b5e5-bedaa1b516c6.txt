Mashawn is a construction worker who is working on the Eiffel Tower. He is working on the scaffolding around the tower, and he is wearing a safety harness. He is using a power drill to drill holes into the scaffolding. The noise of the drill echoes under the tower. Mashawn is sweating, and his muscles are straining as he works. He is concentrated and focused on his work. Suddenly, there is a loud noise from above. Mashawn looks up and sees that one of the scaffolding poles has snapped and is falling towards him. He tries to move out of the way, but the pole hits him and knocks him off the scaffolding. Mashawn screams as he falls. He hits the ground hard and is knocked unconscious.
