Sandy is a stay-at-home mom who is out for a walk with her kids. They're playing and laughing as they walk around the Eiffel Tower. It's a beautiful evening and the sun is just starting to set. The sky is a deep blue and the lights of the city are just starting to twinkle. Sandy's kids are having a great time and she's enjoying watching them play.
