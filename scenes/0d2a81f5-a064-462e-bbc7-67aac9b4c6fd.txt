Bob stood at the edge of the mountaintop, gazing out at the vast landscape before him. The moonlight cast a eerie glow over the scene, and Bob could just make out the outline of the mountains in the distance. A cold wind blew through the air, and Bob wrapped his coat tightly around himself. He had always wanted to see the Alps, and now he was finally here. Bob had arrived in Europe a few days ago, and he had been exploring the area ever since. He had visited a few small towns and villages, but this was the first time he had ventured into the mountains. He had seen pictures of the Alps before, but they didn't do them justice. The real thing was so much more impressive. Bob was about to turn and head back to his hotel when he heard a noise behind him. He spun around, but there was nothing there. The wind must have blown a branch or something, he thought. But then he heard the noise again, and this time he was sure it was coming from the other side of the mountain. Bob started to feel uneasy. He knew he shouldn't be out here in the middle of the night by himself. But he was curious to see what was making the noise. Bob carefully made his way down the side of the mountain, using his hands to help him balance. He was getting closer and closer to the noise, and he was starting to get a bad feeling about it. Finally, Bob came to a small clearing and saw what was making the noise. There was a large, furry creature standing in the middle of the clearing, and it was making a strange noise. Bob had never seen anything like it before. The creature suddenly noticed Bob, and it let out a loud roar. Bob was so startled that he fell backwards, tumbling down the side of the mountain. He hit his head on a rock and everything went black.
