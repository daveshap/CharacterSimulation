Gabbi is a babysitter who is currently watching over a group of children on a mountaintop in Europe. It is a beautiful day outside, and the children are enjoying themselves playing in the snow. Gabbi is keeping a close eye on them, making sure they stay safe. Suddenly, Gabbi hears a loud noise coming from the other side of the mountain. She looks over and sees a large avalanche coming down towards them. Gabbi knows she needs to act fast. She grabs the children and starts to run down the mountain as fast as she can. The avalanche is gaining on them, but Gabbi is determined to get the children to safety. She manages to make it to the bottom of the mountain just in time, and the children are safe.
