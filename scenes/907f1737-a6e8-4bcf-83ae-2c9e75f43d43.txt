Tom is a bartender at a small bar in Africa. It's 6pm and the bar is starting to fill up with people looking for a place to drink and relax after a long day. Tom is busy making drinks and chatting with the customers. He knows most of them by name and they all seem to like him. Suddenly, the door bursts open and a group of men come into the bar. They're armed with guns and knives and they're all wearing masks. Tom freezes. The men start shouting and demanding money from the customers. They threaten to kill anyone who doesn't comply. Tom is terrified. He has no idea what to do. The men start picking people up and shaking them down for their valuables. They take the money from the till and start to head towards the door. As they're leaving, one of the men grabs Tom and puts a gun to his head. He tells Tom to empty the till. Tom does as he's told and the man gives him a stack of cash. The men then leave the bar, leaving Tom and the other customers behind. Tom is shaking and he can't believe what just happened. This is the worst day of his life.
