The city bustles with activity even as the sun sets. Streetlights flicker to life, illuminating the sidewalk where Swathi hurries along. She's on her way home from work, eager to put her feet up and relax after a long day. The sounds of horns and footsteps echo around her as she weaves through the crowd, finally arriving at her apartment building. She fumbles for her keys, unlocking the door and stepping inside. The apartment is quiet and empty, and Swathi is hit with a sudden wave of loneliness. She pushes it away, heading to the kitchen to start dinner. As she cooks, her mind wanders back to her work day. She's been struggling with her project for weeks now, and her boss is starting to get impatient. Swathi is determined to find a solution, but she's feeling drained. She sits down at the table with her dinner, picking at her food distractedly. Tomorrow is another long day, and she's not sure how much more she can take.
