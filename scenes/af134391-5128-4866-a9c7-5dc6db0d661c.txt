Tom is tending bar at a small roadside inn in Africa. It's dusk, and the sun is setting. A few locals are sitting at the bar, chatting and drinking. Tom is busy cleaning glasses and getting the place ready for the evening rush. Suddenly, the door opens and a group of heavily armed men enter the bar. Tom knows immediately that they're not here for a friendly drink. The men start demanding money and valuables from the patrons. Tom tries to stay calm, but he's terrified. He knows that if he does anything to provoke the men, they could easily kill him and the other innocent people in the bar. The men are getting agitated, and Tom can see that they're about to start looting the place. He knows he has to act fast. Tom reaches under the bar and grabs a shotgun. He points it at the men and orders them to leave. The men laugh at Tom, but they can see the resolve in his eyes. They know he's not afraid to use the shotgun if necessary. The men slowly back out of the bar, still laughing. But Tom knows that this isn't over. He knows that they'll be back.
