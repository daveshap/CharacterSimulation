Wang is driving his truck along the quiet beach. It's a beautiful day, and the sun is shining. He sees a group of people in the distance, and he slows down. As he gets closer, he can see that they're playing volleyball. He smiles and keeps driving. Further down the beach, he sees a woman sunbathing. He can't help but stare at her for a moment. She's wearing a bikini, and she has a great body. He averts his eyes and continues driving. He eventually arrives at his destination, a small cottage by the beach. He parks his truck and starts to unload the boxes. He's just about finished when he sees the woman from the beach walking towards him. She's carrying a beach towel and a bottle of sunscreen. "Hi," she says. "Do you need some help with those?" Wang smiles and nods. "Sure, thanks." Together, they finish unloading the boxes and carry them into the cottage. Wang can't help but feel attracted to the woman, and he can tell that she feels the same way about him. However, they both know that nothing can happen between them, so they just enjoy each other's company and go their separate ways.
