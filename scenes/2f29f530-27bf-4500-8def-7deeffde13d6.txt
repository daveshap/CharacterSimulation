Wang is driving his truck through the darkness, his headlights cutting through the night. He's delivering a shipment of supplies to a remote village in Africa, and he knows he has to be careful. There are often bandits on these roads, looking to steal whatever they can. Wang keeps his hand on the steering wheel, his eyes scanning the road ahead. He's getting close to his destination, but he doesn't let his guard down. Suddenly, he sees movement in the bushes by the side of the road. He slows down, his heart racing. He knows he shouldn't stop, but he can't just leave someone stranded in the middle of the night. He hesitates for a moment, then decides to stop. He cautiously gets out of the truck, his hand on his gun. He approaches the bushes, and a man jumps out at him, brandishing a knife. Wang jumps back, his heart pounding. He draws his gun and fires, hitting the man in the chest. The man falls to the ground, dead. Wang stands there for a moment, his hand shaking. He knows he had no choice, but killing someone is never easy. He takes a deep breath and gets back in the truck, driving the rest of the way to his destination.
