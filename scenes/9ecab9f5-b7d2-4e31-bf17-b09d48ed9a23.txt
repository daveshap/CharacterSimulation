The sky is a deep black, punctured by a million stars. The horizon is a sharp line, dividing the inky sky from the equally dark surface of the moon. Wang is driving his delivery truck across the lunar landscape. He's been on the job for hours, and he's getting tired. He has a few more deliveries to make before he can call it a day. The truck lurches to a stop. Wang curses under his breath. He knows he should have gotten the truck serviced before undertaking this job. He's going to have to walk the rest of the way. He climbs out of the truck and starts walking. He's not sure how far he has to go, but he knows it's not far. He's been making these deliveries for weeks, and he's gotten to know the terrain well. The ground is uneven and rocky. Wang has to watch his step so he doesn't trip and fall. He's getting close to his destination. He can see the lights of the research station in the distance. He's almost there when he hears a noise. He stops and listens, but he can't quite place it. It sounds like something is moving around in the rocks. Wang starts to feel uneasy. He's about to turn back when he sees a pair of eyes shine in the darkness. Wang freezes. He's not sure what to do. The eyes move closer, and Wang can see that they belong to a large creature. The creature is definitely not human. Wang has no idea what it is. He's never seen anything like it before. The creature is moving closer and Wang is paralyzed with fear. He's about to turn and run when the creature speaks. "Hello," it says. "I'm not going to hurt you." Wang is so surprised that he doesn't know what to say. "I'm just here to deliver a message," the creature continues. "You need to leave this place. It's not safe here anymore." Wang is still in shock, but he manages to nod. "Okay," he says. "I'll go." The creature nods and then disappears back into the darkness. Wang doesn't know what to think. He's never seen anything like that before. He starts to walk back to the truck, but he can't shake the feeling that something is watching him.
