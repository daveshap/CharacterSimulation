Gabbi is a babysitter who is currently sitting in an office building waiting for her employer to come pick her up. It is 6pm and Gabbi is getting a bit antsy as she has been sitting in the same spot for the past few minutes. She looks around the office and sees that it is fairly empty, with only a few people milling about. Gabbi taps her foot impatiently and sighs.
