It's the middle of the night on the moon, and Aleksy the grocery store clerk is just finishing up his shift. He's been working all night, and he's starting to feel a bit tired. But he knows he has to stay awake until his relief arrives. He's just finished stocking the shelves when he hears a noise coming from the back of the store. He's not sure what it is, but it sounds like someone is trying to break in. Aleksy grabs a can of soup off the shelf and heads towards the back of the store, brandishing it like a weapon. But when he gets there, he finds that the noise was just a mouse. He lets out a sigh of relief and puts the soup back on the shelf. Just then, he hears the sound of footsteps on the Moon's surface outside. Someone is coming towards the store. Aleksy goes to the door and peeks out to see who it is. It's his relief, finally. He unlocks the door and lets him in. After Aleksy hands over the keys and his store badge, he heads outside and starts walking home. It's been a long night, and he's looking forward to getting some sleep.
