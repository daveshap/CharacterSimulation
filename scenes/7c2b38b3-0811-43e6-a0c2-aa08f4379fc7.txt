Jenna woke up early on a bright, sunny morning. She felt well-rested and energized, ready to start her day. She got out of bed and walked to her window, looking out at the city. The streets were busy with people walking and cars driving. Jenna saw the skyline in the distance and the tall buildings reaching up into the sky. She took a deep breath and felt thankful to be alive and living in such a beautiful city.
