Swathi arrived at her office building early in the morning, as she usually did. She was a software engineer and worked on developing new software for the company. As she entered the building, she greeted the security guard and made her way to the elevator. She pressed the button for her floor and waited patiently as the elevator ascended. Once she arrived at her floor, she walked down the hallway to her cubicle. She sat down and booted up her computer, ready to start her workday.
