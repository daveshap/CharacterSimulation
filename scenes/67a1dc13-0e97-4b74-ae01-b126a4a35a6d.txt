The concert is in full swing, the band is playing their hearts out on stage and the crowd is going wild. Sandy is standing in the middle of it all, surrounded by people dancing and singing along to the music. She's lost in the moment, enjoying the atmosphere and the feeling of being surrounded by people who are all enjoying themselves. She's not thinking about anything else, just letting the music wash over her and enjoying the moment.
