It's a cold, clear night, and Jenna is huddled under the Eifel Tower, trying to stay warm. She's been here for hours, ever since she ran away from home. She's not sure what she's going to do next, but she knows she can't go back. Jenna hears footsteps approaching, and she tense up, ready to run. But then she recognizes the figure as her friend, Alex. "What are you doing here?" Alex asks. "I ran away," Jenna says. "I can't go back home." "Come on," Alex says. "Let's go somewhere warm. I know a place." Jenna hesitates for a moment, but then she nods and follows Alex away from the Eifel Tower and into the night.
