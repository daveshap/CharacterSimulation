It's early morning, and the sun is just starting to peek over the horizon. The air is still and cool, and the only sound is the birds chirping in the trees. Mashawn is sitting on the porch of his country cottage, enjoying the peacefulness of the morning. He takes a sip of his coffee and looks out at the trees, thinking about the day ahead.
