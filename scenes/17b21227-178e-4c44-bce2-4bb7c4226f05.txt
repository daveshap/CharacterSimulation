The night is dark and quiet, broken only by the sound of crickets and the occasional calls of nocturnal animals. Gabbi is sitting on the porch of the village hut, keeping an eye on the sleeping children inside. She is wrapped in a blanket against the chill of the night, and her head is nodding involuntarily as she tries to stay awake. Suddenly, there is a sound in the bushes, and Gabbi is alert again. She peers into the darkness, trying to see what is there. She is just about to call out for help when a figure steps out from the shadows. Gabbi feels a relief when she sees that it is only the village elder, coming to check on the children. The elder gives Gabbi a reassuring smile, before patting her on the shoulder and walking back into the night. Gabbi settles back down, her eyes once again drooping shut as she tries to stay awake.
