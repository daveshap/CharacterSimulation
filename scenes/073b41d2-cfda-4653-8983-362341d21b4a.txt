The moon is a barren, lifeless place. The only sound is the faint hiss of Sandy's oxygen tank as she moves slowly across the dusty surface. She is wearing a bulky spacesuit and carrying a large backpack filled with supplies. It is the middle of the night, but the sunlight is still bright enough to see by. Sandy is moving cautiously, her eyes darting around for any signs of danger. She knows that there are many hazards on the moon, and she does not want to take any chances. Suddenly, Sandy hears a noise behind her. She freezes, her heart pounding in her chest. She slowly turns around, but there is nothing there. She exhales a sigh of relief and continues on her way. After a few more minutes, Sandy reaches her destination: a small crater that is her home. She climbs down into the crater and sets her backpack down. She is tired from her journey, but she is happy to be home. Sandy takes off her helmet and begins to unpack her supplies, preparing for another long night on the moon.
