Tom is enjoying a quiet lunch on a mountaintop in Europe. The sun is shining and the view is incredible. He's grateful for the peace and quiet after a busy morning at work. Suddenly, Tom hears a loud noise. He turns to see a large boulder tumbling down the mountain towards him. He has just enough time to dive out of the way before it crashes down, narrowly avoiding being crushed. Tom is shaken but uninjured. He looks up to see a group of climbers descending the mountain. One of them has lost their footing and their rope is dragging them down. Tom knows he has to act fast if he wants to save them. He grabs a nearby tree and swings out over the edge of the cliff. He grabs the rope and starts to pull the climber to safety. The climber is grateful and Tom is hailed as a hero.
