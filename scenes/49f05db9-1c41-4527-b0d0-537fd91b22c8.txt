The sun sets behind the mountains, painting the sky in a spectrum of oranges, pinks, and purples. A cool breeze awakens Swathi from her reverie. She gazes out at the breathtaking view before her and feels a sense of peacefulness wash over her. She remembers coming to this spot with her family as a child. They would picnic on the blanket and chase each other around in the fading light. She can still see her father's smile and hear her mother's laughter. The memories bring a smile to her face, and she takes a deep breath of the fresh mountain air. She feels lucky to have found this place again and to be able to share it with her own family.
