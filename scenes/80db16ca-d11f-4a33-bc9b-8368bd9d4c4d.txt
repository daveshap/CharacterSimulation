The sun is setting and the lights of the Eiffel Tower are beginning to twinkle. Tom is behind the bar, wiping glasses and getting ready for the evening rush. He's wearing a black apron over his clothes and a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up. His hair is dark and curly, and he has a close-cut beard. He looks up as the first few customers come in and greets them with a smile. The bar is situated under the Eiffel Tower, and the view from the windows is breathtaking. The ceiling is high and vaulted, and the walls are lined with shelves of liquor. The floor is polished wood, and there are small round tables scattered around the room. The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly, and Tom is happy to chat with the customers as he serves them drinks. As the evening wears on, the bar gets busier and Tom is kept busy serving drinks and clearing tables. He laughs and jokes with the customers, and it's obvious that he enjoys his job. He's quick and efficient, and he knows just how to make each customer feel special. As closing time approaches, Tom starts to tidy up the bar, wiping down the surfaces and getting everything ready for the next day. The last few customers finish their drinks and say goodbye, and then Tom is alone in the bar. He locks the doors and turns off the lights, and then he heads home for the night.
