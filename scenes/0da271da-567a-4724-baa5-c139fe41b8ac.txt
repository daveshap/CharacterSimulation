Sandy is lying in bed, awake and restless. She can hear the sounds of the night outside her window - the crickets chirping, the light breeze rustling the leaves of the trees. She knows she should be sleeping, but her mind won't stop racing and she can't seem to get comfortable. She gets out of bed, quietly so as not to wake her husband and children, and goes to the window. She gazes out at the night, wondering what it would be like to be out there, under the stars, with no worries or responsibilities. She knows she can't just run away from her life, but sometimes she feels like she's going to explode if she has to stay in this house one more minute. Sandy turns away from the window and goes back to bed. She lies there for a long time, until finally she falls into a fitful sleep.
