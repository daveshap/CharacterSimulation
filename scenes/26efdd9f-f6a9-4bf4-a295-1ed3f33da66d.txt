It's mid-afternoon and Tom is in his bedroom. He's lying on his bed, fully clothed, with his arm across his eyes. He looks like he's trying to block out the light. There's a half-empty bottle of whiskey on the nightstand, and an empty glass next to it. It's clear that Tom has been drinking. He hears a noise and raises his head to see his girlfriend, Sarah, standing in the doorway. She's holding a suitcase in one hand and a box in the other. There's a look of determination on her face. Tom sits up and Sarah comes into the room. She puts the suitcase and box down and looks at Tom. "I'm leaving," she says. "I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry." Tom looks at her for a moment, then nods. He doesn't say anything. Sarah turns and picks up her things again. She starts to walk out of the room, but pauses and looks back at Tom. "I loved you," she says. "I really did." Then she's gone, and Tom is alone.
