Tom is a bartender at a local office building. It is dusk, and the building is mostly empty except for a few stragglers who are finishing up work for the day. Tom is cleaning up behind the bar, getting ready to close for the night. He hears a noise coming from one of the offices down the hall. He cautiously approaches the office, and peeks inside to see a man ransacking the place. The man is clearly agitated, and Tom is worried he might hurt someone. He decides to intervene and confront the man. Tom approaches the man and asks him what he is doing. The man replies that he is looking for something. Tom asks what he is looking for, but the man doesn't answer. Tom tells the man that he needs to leave the office and come with him. The man resists at first, but eventually agrees and goes with Tom. Tom takes the man outside and calls the police. He tells the dispatcher what happened and gives them the man's description. The man is still agitated and doesn't say anything. The police arrive a few minutes later and take the man into custody. Tom is relieved that the situation is over and that no one was hurt.
