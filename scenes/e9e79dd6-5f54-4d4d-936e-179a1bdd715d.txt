Aleksy had always wanted to see the mountaintops of Europe. They had always looked so peaceful and calming in the pictures he had seen. And now here he was, standing on one himself. He took a deep breath in and closed his eyes, savoring the moment. The sun was just beginning to set, casting a beautiful pink and orange hue in the sky. Aleksy felt like he could stay here forever. Suddenly, he heard a noise in the distance. It sounded like someone was crying. He followed the sound until he came to a clearing. And there he saw a woman, sitting on the ground, her face in her hands. Aleksy approached her cautiously. "Hello? Are you okay?" The woman looked up at him, her eyes red and swollen from crying. "No," she said, her voice shaking. "I'm not okay." Aleksy sat down next to her and put a comforting hand on her back. "It's going to be alright," he said softly. "Whatever it is, we'll figure it out." The woman took a deep breath and began to tell him her story. She had come up here to see the sunset, just like he had. But she had gotten lost on the way back down. She had been walking for hours, and she was starting to get cold and hungry. Aleksy listened sympathetically as she spoke. Then he stood up and held out his hand to her. "Come on," he said. "I'll take you back to my village. We'll get you something to eat and a warm place to sleep." The woman took his hand and Aleksy helped her to her feet. Together, they began the walk back down the mountain.
