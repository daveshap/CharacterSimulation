The sun is just peeking over the horizon, casting a pale light over the lunar landscape. Bob is busy preparing for the day at his coffee shop, making sure everything is just right. He's been working hard to get his business off the ground, and he knows that first impressions are important. The door to the shop opens, and Bob's first customer of the day walks in. Bob greets him with a friendly smile and asks him what he can get for him. The customer orders a cup of coffee, and Bob sets to work making it. He chats with the customer as he works, making small talk about the weather and the news. The coffee shop quickly fills up with customers, and Bob is kept busy serving them all. He loves his job, and he can tell that his customers appreciate the care he takes in making their coffee just the way they like it. The hours fly by, and soon it's time to close up shop. Bob says goodbye to his last customer of the day, flipping the sign on the door to 'closed'. He's exhausted, but he's also happy. He's worked hard to build up his business, and it's paying off. He can't wait to do it all again tomorrow.
