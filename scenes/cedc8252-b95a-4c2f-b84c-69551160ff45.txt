Gabbi is walking through the forest, holding a torch in one hand and a baby in the other. She is careful to watch her step, as the ground is uneven and there are roots and rocks protruding from the earth. She has been walking for some time, and she is now quite tired. The baby is getting heavy, and her arm is starting to throb from the effort of carrying it. She turns a corner, and the forest opens up into a small clearing. In the center of the clearing is a small, dilapidated cabin. Gabbi approaches the cabin cautiously, her heart pounding in her chest. She knows that this is where the witch lives. She knocks on the door of the cabin, and a few moments later, an old woman answers. The woman is hunched over and has a long, hooked nose. She is wearing a tattered black dress and a black shawl. "Who are you?" the woman hisses. "I'm Gabbi," the babysitter responds. "I'm here to drop off the baby." The witch takes the baby from Gabbi's arms and cackles wickedly. "Thank you, my dear. You have served me well." Gabbi turns and runs back the way she came, her heart pounding in her chest. She knows that she has just delivered a baby to a monster, and she will never forget the look on the witch's face.
