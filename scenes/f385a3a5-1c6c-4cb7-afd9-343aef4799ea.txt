Aleksy, a grocery store clerk, is walking through a dark forest in South America. He is holding a flashlight in one hand and a machete in the other. His clothes are torn and he has several scratches on his face and arms. He is obviously lost and scared. He keeps looking around, as if expecting something to jump out at him at any moment. He stops often to listen, but all he can hear is the sound of his own breathing and the pounding of his heart. Suddenly, he hears a branch snap. He whirls around, shining his flashlight in the direction of the sound. But there's nothing there. Just trees and shadows. He starts to walk again, faster now, his heart pounding in his chest. He knows he's being watched. He can feel it. But he doesn't know what to do. He can't go back the way he came. He has to keep going forward. He doesn't see the snake until it's too late. It strikes him on the leg and he yelps in pain. He swings his machete wildly, trying to hit it, but he misses. The snake strikes again and Aleksy falls to the ground, screaming in fear and pain. And then he's being dragged into the darkness, his screams echoing through the forest.
