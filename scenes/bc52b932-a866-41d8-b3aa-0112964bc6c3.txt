Mashawn is busy at work, hammering away at some bolts on the underside of the Eiffel Tower. He's been working on this section for a few hours now, and he's starting to get hungry. He takes a quick break to eat his lunch, sitting on a girder with his feet dangling over the edge. He looks out at the view of Paris spread out below him and takes a deep breath of the fresh air. What a day to be working on the Eiffel Tower!
