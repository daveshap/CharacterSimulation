The crowd is electric, jumping and cheering as the band plays their final song. Jenna is in the middle of the mosh pit, surrounded by sweaty bodies bumping into her from all sides. She's elbowing and pushing her way through the crowd, trying to get closer to the stage. She can see the band members' faces now, they're dripping with sweat and grinning from ear to ear. She's so close, she can reach out and touch them. Suddenly, the music stops and the lights come on. Jenna blinks, trying to adjust to the sudden brightness. The crowd around her starts to disperse, and she realizes the concert is over. She's disappointed, but also a little relieved. Her arms and legs are sore from all the pushing and elbow-throwing. As she makes her way out of the venue, she spots a group of her friends. They wave her over, and she joins them as they head to the after-party.
