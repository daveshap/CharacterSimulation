It is a beautiful day and Swathi is enjoying her lunch break on a mountaintop in Europe. The sun is shining and the view is stunning. Swathi is happy to be surrounded by such natural beauty. Suddenly, she hears a loud noise. It sounds like an avalanche! Swathi looks around in panic and sees a huge wall of snow coming towards her. She has no time to run. She can only watch as the avalanche engulfs her. Fortunately, Swathi is buried alive. She is able to reach her phone and call for help. After what feels like hours, she is finally rescued. She is cold and shaken, but otherwise unharmed. This was a close call for Swathi. She will never forget the experience of being buried alive.
