It's lunch time, and Mashawn is sitting at his desk in the office, eating his lunch. He's got a sandwich and a can of soda, and he's looking out the window at the construction site across the street. He can see the workers being busy, and he can hear the sound of the equipment they're using. It's a nice day, and Mashawn is enjoying his lunch.
