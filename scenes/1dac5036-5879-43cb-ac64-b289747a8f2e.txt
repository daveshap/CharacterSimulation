Aleksy is sitting on the beach, enjoying the quiet evening. The sun is just starting to set, and the air is still warm. Aleksy is watching the waves crash against the shore and thinking about his life. He's been working at the grocery store for years, and he's starting to feel like he's in a rut. He's never traveled or done anything exciting, and he's starting to wonder if there's more to life than just working and paying bills. Aleksy's thoughts are interrupted by the sound of someone approaching. He turns to see a woman walking towards him. She's carrying a picnic basket, and she has a wide smile on her face. The woman introduces herself as Maria, and she tells Aleksy that she's been watching him from her house nearby. She says that she can tell that he's a good person, and she wants to be his friend. Aleksy is hesitant at first, but he eventually agrees to spend some time with Maria. They sit down on the beach and start talking. Maria tells Aleksy about her life and her travels. She's been all over the world, and she's had some amazing experiences. Aleksy listens with envy, but he also feels happy just to be talking to someone who has done something with their life. As the sun sets, Maria and Aleksy watch the stars come out. They talk about their dreams and what they want to do with their lives. Aleksy tells Maria that he's always wanted to travel, and Maria offers to take him on a trip around the world. Aleksy is hesitant at first, but he eventually agrees. And so, Aleksy's adventure begins.
