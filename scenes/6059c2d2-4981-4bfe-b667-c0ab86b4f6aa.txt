The sun is beating down on the savannah, sending waves of heat up from the parched earth. In the distance, Sandy can see a herd of zebras grazing, theirstripes providing little relief from the intense heat. Closer to her, a group of baboons are engaged in a spirited game of chase, leaping and bounding through the scrubby vegetation. Sandy is sitting in the shade of a acacia tree, watching her two young children play. Her toddler is busy digging in the sand, while her older child is chasing butterflies. Every now and then, Sandy's gaze wanders to the horizon, where she can see the hazy outline of mountains in the distance. It's another day in Africa, and Sandy is content to while away the hours watching her children play and the wildlife go about their business.
