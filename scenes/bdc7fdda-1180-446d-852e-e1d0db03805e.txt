It was lunch time, and Tom was taking a break from his bartending duties to explore the dark forest near his South American village. He had been warned by the elders not to venture into the forest alone, but he was feeling adventurous today and decided to take his chances. As he walked deeper into the woods, the light began to fade and the trees became thicker and more menacing. Suddenly, he heard a noise in the distance and froze in his tracks. Was it a animal? Or something more sinister? He crept forward cautiously, his heart racing, and peered around a tree to see what was making the noise. To his shock, he saw a massive, furry creature standing over a dead body, gnawing hungrily on the bones. The creature looked up and locked eyes with Tom, and for a moment, time seemed to stand still. Then, with a guttural snarl, the creature charged towards him. Tom turned and sprinted back the way he had come, terror coursing through his veins. He could hear the creature's footsteps pounding the ground behind him, getting closer and closer. Just as it was about to catch him, he tripped over a tree root and went sprawling to the ground. The creature was upon him in an instant, its drooling jaws opening wide to devour him. But before it could take a bite, Tom felt something sharp pierce his neck and everything went black.
