Swathi is a software engineer who works long hours at her job. She finally gets a break at 6pm, and she's eager to relax in her bedroom. She kicks off her shoes and floops down onto her bed, taking a deep breath. Ah, it feels good to be home. She stretches her arms and legs, letting her muscles loosen up. She closes her eyes and lets her mind wander, taking a much-needed break from work.
