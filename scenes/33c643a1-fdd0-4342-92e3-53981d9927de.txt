Aleksy is walking along the beach, enjoying the quiet night. The waves crash against the shore, and the stars shine overhead. He takes a deep breath of the salty air and smiles. Suddenly, he hears a noise behind him. He turns around and sees a shadowy figure running towards him. Aleksy's heart races as he wonders what to do. Should he run away or confront the person? He decides to stand his ground and sees that the person is a woman. She looks frantic and seems to be running from something. Aleksy asks her if she's okay, but she doesn't seem to hear him. She runs past him and continues down the beach. Aleksy is about to follow her when he hears more noise. This time, it sounds like someone is coming towards him. He turns around and sees a group of men walking towards him with angry looks on their faces. They seem to be looking for the woman. Aleksy is torn about what to do, but he knows he can't just let them hurt her. He runs after the woman to warn her.
