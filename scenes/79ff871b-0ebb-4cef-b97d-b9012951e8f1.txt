Aleksy had been walking for hours, ever since he had become separated from his group during the night. He wasn't even sure where he was anymore, except that he knew he was somewhere in the dark forest in South America. His only hope was to find his way out before nightfall. As he continued to walk, he heard a branch snap nearby. Aleksy froze, straining to see through the darkness. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the trees and Aleksy let out a scream before he was silenced by a strong hand over his mouth.
