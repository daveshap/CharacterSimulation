Wang, a delivery driver, is making his final delivery of the day to an office building. It is evening, and the office is mostly empty, with only a few lights still on in the windows. Wang pulls up to the front of the building and parks his van. He takes the package out of the van and walks up to the front door of the building. He presses the buzzer for the office, and after a moment, someone buzzes him in. Wang walks through the lobby and up to the elevator. He presses the button for the floor his package is going to, and the elevator doors close. Wang rides the elevator up to the correct floor, and walks down the hallway to the correct office. He knocks on the door, and after a moment, someone answers. Wang hands them the package and says goodbye. The person in the office thanks Wang and closes the door. Wang walks back to the elevator and presses the button for the lobby. The elevator doors close, and Wang begins his ride back down to the lobby.
