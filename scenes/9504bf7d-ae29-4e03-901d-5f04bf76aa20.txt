Sandy is walking home from her daughter's soccer practice, carrying a bag of groceries. The streets are busy with rush-hour traffic and the sidewalks are crowded with pedestrians. Sandy is thinking about what she needs to make for dinner tonight. As she approaches her apartment building, she notices a homeless man rummaging through a garbage can. He doesn't seem to have noticed her yet. Sandy feels a twinge of pity for the man, but she doesn't want to get too close. Suddenly, the man looks up and makes eye contact with Sandy. He starts to say something, but Sandy quickly turns away and hurries into her building.
