Swathi is sitting on the beach, watching the sunset. She's thinking about her life and how she's grateful for what she has. She's also thinking about her future and what she wants to do with her life. She's been working as a software engineer for the past few years, but she's starting to feel like she's not doing what she really wants to do. She's beginning to think that maybe she wants to do something else with her life. She's not sure what, but she knows that she wants to make a change.
