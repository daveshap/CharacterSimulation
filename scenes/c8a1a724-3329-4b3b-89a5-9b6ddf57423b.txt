Aleksy is in his bedroom, lying on his bed. He is wearing jeans and a t-shirt. He is mid-afternoon. The sun is shining through the window, and the room is filled with light. Aleksy is staring at the ceiling, and he looks bored. Suddenly, he hears a knock at the door. He gets up and opens it, and he is surprised to see his boss, Mr. Kowalski. Mr. Kowalski is a short, stocky man in his 50s. He is wearing a suit and tie. He looks serious. He holds a envelope in his hand. "Aleksy," he says. "I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but we're going to have to let you go." Aleksy is stunned. He can't believe what he's hearing. "But why?" he asks. "I'm sorry," Mr. Kowalski says. "It's just not working out. We're going to have to let you go." Aleksy can't believe it. He's been working at the grocery store for years, and he's never been in trouble. He's always been a good employee. "I'm sorry, Aleksy," Mr. Kowalski says. "but you'll have to leave immediately. I'll have someone come and collect your things." Aleksy is heartbroken. He can't believe he's being fired. He doesn't know what he's going to do.
