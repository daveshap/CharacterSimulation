Mashawn is standing in the middle of a huge concert hall, surrounded by people milling about and chatting. He's wearing a hard hat and construction boots, and he looks a bit out of place. He's holding a lunch box in one hand and a thermos in the other. He takes a sip from his thermos and looks around, taking in the sights and sounds of the concert hall. He's never been to a place like this before, and he's impressed by the size and scale of the place. He sees people dressed up in fancy clothes, sipping champagne and nibbling on canap√©s. He notices a few security guards posted around the perimeter of the room, and he wonders what they're there for. Suddenly, he feels someone bump into him from behind. He spins around to see a tall, blonde woman stumbling backwards, her face red with embarrassment. She mutters an apology and scurries away. Mashawn shakes his head and turns back to the concert hall. He can hear the faint sound of music drifting through the air, and he wonders what it would be like to hear it up close. He finishing his drink and puts his thermos back into his lunch box. Then he heads over to the nearest security guard and asks if he can go inside. The guard looks him up and down and then nods. Mashawn thanks him and Hurries inside. He finds a seat near the front of the hall and just looks around, marveling at the beauty of the place. He can feel the beat of the music pulsing through his body, and he can see the dancers onstage, whirling and spinning in time to the music. He's entranced by the whole experience, and he doesn't want it to end. But eventually, the concert does come to an end, and the crowd starts to filtering out. Mashawn stays in his seat for a few moments longer, just soaking it all in. Then he gets up and heads back outside, a huge smile on his face.
