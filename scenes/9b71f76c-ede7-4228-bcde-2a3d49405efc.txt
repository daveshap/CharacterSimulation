It's a beautiful day and Wang is enjoying his lunch break on a mountaintop in Europe. The scenery is breathtaking and he's surrounded by peace and quiet. He's enjoying a meal of rice and vegetables when he hears a loud noise. It sounds like someone is coming up the mountain. Wang gets up to see who it is and sees a group of hikers struggling up the trail. They look exhausted and are covered in sweat. Wang waves to them and they wave back. He watch them for a few minutes before they disappear over the top of the mountain.
