Gabbi is sitting on a bench under the Eifel Tower, eating her lunch and watching as the tourists pass by. She people-watches for a while, enjoying the diverse mix of people from all over the world who are all here to see this iconic landmark. After a while, she checks her phone and realizes that it's time to pick up her charge, a little girl named Emma, from school. She finishes her lunch and heads off to get Emma.
