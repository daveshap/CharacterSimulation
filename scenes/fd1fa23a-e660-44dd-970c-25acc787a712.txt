Wang is driving his delivery truck through a dark forest in South America. He is on a winding dirt road and the trees are so thick that he can barely see the sky. Suddenly, he comes around a bend and sees a large, furry creature blocking the road. Wang slams on the brakes and the truck skids to a stop. The creature is standing on its hind legs and is taller than the truck. It has long, sharp claws and is glaring at Wang with its bright eyes. Wang's heart is racing and he is terrified. He does not know what to do. The creature takes a step towards the truck and Wang frantically tries to think of a way to escape. Suddenly, he has an idea. He opens the door of the truck and tries to drive away, but the creature is too fast. It grabs the truck with its claws and flips it over. Wang is thrown from the truck and hits his head on a rock. He is unconscious. The creature drags Wang's unconscious body into the woods and begins to eat him. Wang is unaware of what is happening as he is being devoured by the creature.
