Gabbi arrived at the cottage a little before six. She was babysitting for the night while the parents went out for a date night. Gabbi had been babysitting for the family for about a year and the kids loved her. She was greeted at the door by the two kids, a boy and a girl who were ages six and eight. They were excited to see her and immediately started asking her about the fun activities they were going to do that night. Gabbi settled them down with some dinner while she finished getting things ready for the night. She had planned to do some baking with the kids and then let them watch a movie before bed. The kids were excited to help with the baking and they had a lot of fun decorating the cookies. After the cookies were done, they settled in to watch their movie. Gabbi sat with them and watched the movie, but she was also secretly keeping an eye on the time. She wanted to make sure the kids were in bed at a decent hour so their parents wouldn't have to worry about them. The movie ended and Gabbi helped the kids get ready for bed. She read them a story and then tucked them in. The kids gave her a big hug and told her they had a lot of fun. Gabbi said goodnight and then went to clean up the kitchen. She finished up her chores and then settled down to watch some TV herself. It was going to be a long night, but Gabbi was happy to be spending it with the two kids.
