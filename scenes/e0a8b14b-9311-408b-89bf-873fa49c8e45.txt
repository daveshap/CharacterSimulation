Sandy is sitting on a mountaintop in Europe, in the middle of the night. She is wearing a white gown and has a small group of people with her. Sandy is chanting and holding a crystal in her hand. The crystal is glowing brightly. Sandy's eyes are closed and she seems to be in a trance. The people with her are also chanting. They are all facing the same direction, towards the east.
