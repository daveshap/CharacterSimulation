Sandy is standing on the beach, looking out at the water. It's a beautiful night, and the moon is shining brightly. She can see the waves crashing against the shore, and the stars twinkling in the sky. She takes a deep breath and feels the warm, salty air fill her lungs. She's been coming to this beach for years, ever since she was a child. It's always been her favorite place to be. There's something about the peacefulness of the ocean that makes her feel at ease. Tonight, she's come to the beach to think about her life. She's been feeling restless lately, like she's not sure what she's supposed to be doing. She loves being a mother, but she can't help but feel like there's more to life than just taking care of her family. She's not sure what the future holds, but standing here on the beach, looking out at the vastness of the ocean, she feels like anything is possible.
