bob is walking Under the Eifel Tower at night. He's admiring the lit-up structure and thinking about how Paris is such a beautiful city. He's headed to his coffee shop, which is nearby. As he walks, he thinks about how his business is doing and how he's considering expanding. He's also thinking about his personal life and whether or not he's ready to settle down. He reaches his shop and unlocks the door, flipping on the lights. He gets started on brewing a pot of coffee, thinking about how he's looking forward to a quiet evening.
