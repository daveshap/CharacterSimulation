The sun is setting and Jenna finds herself in the middle of a dark forest. She's not sure how she got here, but she knows she needs to find her way back home. She starts to walk, but it's difficult to see where she's going. She trips over a root and falls to the ground. She looks around and sees a light in the distance. She gets up and starts to walk towards the light. As she gets closer, she realizes it's a campfire. She sees people sitting around the fire, and she walks up to them. She asks them how to get back home, but they don't understand her. They start to speak in a different language. Jenna doesn't know what to do. She sits down by the fire and tries to think of a way to get home.
