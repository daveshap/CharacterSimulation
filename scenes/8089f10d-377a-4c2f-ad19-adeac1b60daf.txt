The sun is setting behind the mountains, casting a pink and orange glow in the sky. Tom is standing on a mountaintop, overlooking a valley below. He's been hiking all day and is now enjoying a break before heading back down. The air is cool and crisp, and Tom can see his breath in the air. He takes a deep breath and feels the exhaustion of the day start to seep out of his muscles. He looks down at the valley and watches as the lights start to come on in the buildings below. He can see a few people walking around, and the sound of laughter carries up to him on the breeze. He looks up at the stars and feels a sense of peace wash over him. It's moments like this that make him love his job as a bartender. He can't think of anywhere he'd rather be than right here, right now.
