The sun beats down mercilessly on the dusty plains of Africa. In the distance, a lone figure can be seen trudging along, weighed down by a heavy load. This is Wang, a delivery driver, who is making his way to the next village. Wang has been walking for hours, and he is beginning to tire. The heat and the weight of the package he is carrying are taking their toll. He takes a brief break to rest in the shade of a tree. He drinks some water from his canteen and eats a little of the food he has with him. After a short rest, Wang begins walking again. He knows he cannot stop for long, as he has to make the delivery before nightfall. He passes through the village and heads out into the wilderness again. As the sun begins to set, Wang finally arrives at his destination. He is met by the village elder, who takes the package from him. Wang is relieved to have made the delivery safely. He thanks the elder and begins the long walk back to the village.
