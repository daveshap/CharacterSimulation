Aleksy is standing in the middle of a crowded concert hall, surrounded by people dancing and singing along to the music. He looks up at the stage, where the band is playing, and feels a sense of joy and excitement. He looks around at the people around him, and feels a sense of connection to them. He feels alive and happy in this moment.
