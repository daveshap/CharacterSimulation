Sandy is sitting at her desk, surrounded by stacks of paper. Her computer is on, but the screen is blank. She is wearing a headset, and she is tapping her fingers impatiently on the desk. She looks around the room, and her eyes settle on the door. Suddenly, she stands up and walks to the door. She opens it, and she sees her husband, Bob, standing there. "Hi, Sandy," he says. "I thought I'd surprise you with a visit." "Hi, Bob," she says. "Come on in." He walk into the room, and he looks around. "This place is a mess," he says. "What have you been doing all day?" "I've been trying to get some work done," she says. "But it's hard to concentrate with the kids at home." "Well, maybe you should get a babysitter," he says. "It would be good for you to get out of the house." "I don't know," she says. "I'm not sure I'm ready to leave the kids." "It would be good for you," he says. "And it would give me a chance to spend more time with them." "Maybe you're right," she says. "I'll think about it."
