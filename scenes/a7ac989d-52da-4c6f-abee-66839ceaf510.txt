Tom enters the bedroom and immediately notices the fallen picture frame on the floor. He knows his wife won't be happy about this, so he quickly tries to clean up the mess before she gets home. He picks up the frame and sets it back on the nightstand, but the glass is shattered and the photo is ruined. He looks around for something to cover the frame with, but can't find anything. He ends up using a shirt from the laundry basket to drape over the frame. He knows it's not a perfect solution, but it will have to do until he can buy a new frame. He hears his wife's car pull up in the driveway and hurriedly finishes cleaning up the bedroom. He knows she's going to be tired from work and doesn't want to add to her stress. As she enters the bedroom, Tom can tell she's not happy. She looks around the room and sees the shirt-covered frame on the nightstand. She knows he was trying to help, but she can't hide her disappointment. Tom tries to apologize, but his wife is already exhausted from her day and doesn't want to deal with this right now. She tells him to just leave it and goes to take a shower. Tom knows he's messed up, but he's grateful that his wife is at least willing to let him try to make things right. He's determined to find a new frame for the picture as soon as possible.
