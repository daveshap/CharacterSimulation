Aleksy had been working the night shift at the grocery store for nearly a year now, and he was used to the ebb and flow of the late-night customers. But tonight, things were different. It was dead quiet. Not a single soul had come in or out of the store in hours. The stillness was unnerving. Aleksy tried to take his mind off of it by straightening up the shelves and mopping the floors, but eventually he ran out of things to do. He leaned against the counter and watched the minutes tick by on the clock, longing for the shift to end. Suddenly, he heard a noise coming from the back of the store. Something was moving around in the stockroom. Aleksy's heart started to race. He had never been back there alone at night before, and the thought of someone else being in the store with him was terrifying. He slowly made his way to the back, his hand trembling as he reached for the light switch. He flipped it on, and the stockroom was immediately bathed in light. Aleksy swallowed hard, mustering up the courage to take a step into the room. But before he could take even one step, he heard the back door swing open. Someone was coming in. Aleksy's heart was pounding in his chest as he cowered in the stockroom, waiting for the intruders to make their way into the store. But instead of the footsteps he was expecting, he heard a strange, ethereal voice. "Aleksy," the voice said. "We've been waiting for you."
