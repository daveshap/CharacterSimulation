The mountaintop is blanketed in a thick layer of fog, making it difficult to see more than a few feet in front of Sandy. She's been hiking for hours, and she's exhausted. She stops to take a break, and leans against a large rock to catch her breath. Suddenly, she hears a noise in the distance. It sounds like someone is calling her name. Sandy can't see anyone, but she starts to walk towards the sound. The fog gets thicker and thicker, until she can't see her hand in front of her face. She's disoriented and lost. The noise gets louder and Sandy starts to run. She stumbles and falls, hitting her head on a rock. sandy is knocked unconscious.
