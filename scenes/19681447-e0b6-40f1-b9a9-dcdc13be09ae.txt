It's a quiet night at the cottage. Aleksy is in bed, just about to drift off to sleep when he hears a noise outside. He gets up to investigate and sees a figure moving around in the shadows near the bushes. He watches as the figure comes closer to the house and then suddenly disappearing around the side. Aleksy is about to go back to bed when he hears the sound of glass breaking. He knows someone is trying to break into the house! He grabs a flashlight and heads outside to confront the intruder.
