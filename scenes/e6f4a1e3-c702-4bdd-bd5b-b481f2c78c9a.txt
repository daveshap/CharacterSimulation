She is concentrating hard, and her fingers fly over the keyboard as she types. Suddenly, she hears a noise outside her office door. It sounds like someone is trying to open it. She gets up from her desk and goes to the door, peac She opens the door to find a security guard standing there. He tells her that there has been a report of a intruder in the building, and he is there to investigate. Swathi tells him that she has not seen anything, but the guard says that he needs to check her office anyway. He enters the office and begins looking around. Swathi stands there, watching him. After a few minutes, the guard is satisfied that there is no intruder and leaves. Swathi goes back to her desk and continues working on her project.
