Gabbi is sitting on the moon, eating her lunch and enjoying the view. She's been babysitting for the past few hours and is ready to take a break. It's a beautiful day on the moon, and she's surrounded by the bright, white landscape. She can see the Earth in the distance, and it looks so peaceful. She's happy to be able to sit and relax for a few minutes before she has to go back to work.
