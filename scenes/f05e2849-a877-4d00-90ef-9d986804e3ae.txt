It's the middle of the night, and Jenna is huddled in the corner of her office building, trying to stay warm. She's been here for hours, ever since she got locked out of her apartment. She's tried everything to get back in, but the doors are all locked and she can't find a way to climb up to her window. She's starting to feel really cold and hungry, and she's starting to worry that she's going to have to spend the night here.
