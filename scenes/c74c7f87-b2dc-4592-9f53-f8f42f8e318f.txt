Swathi had always wanted to visit the Eifel Tower. She had seen pictures of it in books and magazines, and it always looked so majestic and grand. Finally, she was able to make the trip and she was not disappointed. The tower was even more beautiful in person. As she walked around the tower, she noticed that there were several people milling about, taking pictures and enjoying the view. She also noticed that the sky was starting to turn a beautiful shade of pink and purple, signifying the onset of dusk. She decided to walk over to the edge of the tower to get a better view of the city as the sun set. As she looked out, she felt a sense of peace and wonder. It was an unforgettable experience.
