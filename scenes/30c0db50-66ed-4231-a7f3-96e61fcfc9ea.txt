Swathi stands underneath the Eiffel Tower, her favourite spot in the city. She's been coming here ever since she moved to Paris for work, and it always makes her feel at home. The sun is setting and the sky is a beautiful orange colour. The tower is lit up and looks even more impressive than usual. Swathi feels a sense of peace and happiness being here. She takes a deep breath and closes her eyes, letting the moment wash over her.
