Sandy is in her bedroom, getting ready for bed. She's wearing a tank top and shorts, and her hair is pulled back in a ponytail. She's just about to turn off the light when she hears a noise downstairs. She freezes, listening carefully. It sounds like someone is walking around in the living room. Sandy's heart starts to race. She's not sure what to do. Should she go downstairs and see who it is, or should she stay upstairs and call the police? After a moment of deliberation, she decides to call the police. She quietly grabs her phone and starts to dial, but before she can finish, she hears someone coming up the stairs. She quickly turns off the light and hides under the covers, trying to make herself as small as possible. She hears the person enter the room and come towards the bed. Sandy's heart is pounding in her chest. She's petrified with fear. Suddenly, the person speaks. "Sandy, it's me. Don't be afraid." Sandy recognizes the voice as her husband's. She lets out a sigh of relief and comes out from under the covers. "Oh, thank goodness," she says. "You scared me half to death." "I'm sorry," he replies. "I didn't mean to scare you. I just forgot my keys and thought I'd try to find them before coming upstairs." "Well, you certainly succeeded in giving me a good scare," she says, laughing. "Next time, just come upstairs and let me know it's you. You don't have to sneak around in the dark." "I will," he says. "I'm sorry again for scaring you." "It's okay," she says, forgiving him. "I love you." "I love you too," he says, before giving her a kiss goodnight.
