The sun is setting, and the stage is illuminated in a warm, golden light. The crowd is cheering and Sandy is standing in the middle of it all, surrounded by people dancing and singing along to the music. She feels happy and free, and she can't help but dance along with the rest of the crowd. The music is loud and Sandy can feel the bass vibrating through her body. She closes her eyes and lets herself get lost in the moment. She's swaying her hips and moving her arms in time with the music, and she's lost in the rhythm. She's surrounded byhappy people, and she feels like she's in the best place in the world.
