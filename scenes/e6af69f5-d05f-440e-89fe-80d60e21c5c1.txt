Mashawn lines up his tools on the floor, making sure they're all within reach. He's been working hard all day and is ready to relax. He kicks off his shoes and flopps down on the bed, letting out a deep sigh. He stares up at the ceiling, letting his mind wander. He thinks about his day and the progress he's made on the construction site. He's proud of his work, but it's tough going. He's glad he has a place to rest his head at night. Suddenly, he hears a noise outside. He sits up, alert and listening. The noise gets louder and he realizes someone is trying to break into his house. He leaps up from the bed and crosses to the door, heart pounding. He grabbs his hammer and stands to the side of the door, waiting for the intruder. The intruder kicks the door open and Mashawn swings his hammer, hitting them in the head. They fall to the ground, unconscious. Mashawn breathes a sigh of relief and drops his hammer. He didn't want to hurt anyone, but he's glad he was able to defend himself.
