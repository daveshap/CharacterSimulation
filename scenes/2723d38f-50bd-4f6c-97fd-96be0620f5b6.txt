The sun is setting behind the mountains, casting a beautiful orange glow over the snow-capped peaks. Gabbi is sitting on a bench, bundled up in a warm coat and scarf, watching the stars come out one by one. She's been babysitting the kids all evening, and they're finally asleep. It's been a long day, but Gabbi is happy to just sit here and enjoy the quiet.
