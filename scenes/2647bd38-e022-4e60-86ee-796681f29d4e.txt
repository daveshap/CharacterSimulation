The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon as Gabbi arrives at the cottage. She unlocks the door and steps inside, taking a moment to appreciate the peacefulness of the place. Everything is tidy and well-kept, with a homey feel that makes her feel immediately at ease. She sets down her bag and goes to check on the children, finding them both fast asleep in their beds. With a smile, she goes about her morning routine of getting breakfast ready and tidying up the house. Outside, the birds are singing and the flowers are just starting to bloom. It's shaping up to be a beautiful day, and Gabbi can't help but feel grateful to be able to spend it in such a lovely place.
