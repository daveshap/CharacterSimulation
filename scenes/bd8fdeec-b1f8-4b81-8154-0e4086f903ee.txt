Jenna is sitting on a fallen tree in a dark forest in South America, eating her lunch. She is surrounded by tall trees and foliage, and the only sound is the occasional bird call. The forest is eerily quiet and Jenna feels a little uneasy. Suddenly, she hears a branch snap and she jumps to her feet, heart pounding. She looks around but doesn't see anything. She tells herself it was just an animal and sits back down, but she can't shake the feeling that someone is watching her.
