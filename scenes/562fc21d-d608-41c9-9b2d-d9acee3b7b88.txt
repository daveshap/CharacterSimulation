It was a hot day in Paris and Tom was working at the bar under the Eiffel Tower. The lunch crowd had just come in and he was busy making drinks. He could see the tourists walking around the tower, taking pictures and enjoying the view. He always loved working in this spot because it was so beautiful. Suddenly, he heard a commotion coming from the other side of the bar. He turned to see a group of people arguing with each other. They were speaking in a language he didn't understand, but he could tell they were angry. Tom tried to stay out of it, but one of the men pushed him and he spilled a drink on the floor. That's when all hell broke loose. The men started fighting with each other and Tom was caught in the middle. He tried to break it up, but they were too strong. Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain in his side and he fell to the ground. He could see the men still fighting, but everything was starting to fade to black. He knew he was going to die. The last thing he saw was the Eiffel Tower standing tall above him.
