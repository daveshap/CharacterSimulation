Swathi is a software engineer who works long hours and often doesn't get home until late at night. Tonight, she finally arrives home around 11pm, exhausted from a long day at work. She enters her bedroom and immediately starts to undress, eager to get into bed and relax. As she begins to take her clothes off, she notices something strange in the room. There is a faint noise coming from the corner of the room. Swathi slowly approaches the corner, trying to see what is making the noise. As she gets closer, she realizes that there is a small, furry creature hiding in the shadows. The creature is a rat, and it looks terrified. It is shaking and its eyes are wide, as if it is terrified of something. Swathi has never seen a rat in her apartment before, and she is not sure what to do. She stands there for a moment, unsure of what to do. Should she try to catch the rat? Should she call animal control? Or should she just ignore it and go to bed? After a moment of deliberation, she decides to just ignore the rat and go to bed. She gets into bed and quickly falls asleep, exhausted from her long day. The rat is still hiding in the corner of the room, trembling in fear.
