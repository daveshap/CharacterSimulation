Wang climbs the last few feet to the mountaintop, gasping for breath in the thin air. He pauses to rest, leaning against a boulder, and looks out over the valley below. The sun is setting, and the sky is turning a deep red. Wang shivers and pulls his jacket tighter around him. He looks down at his watch and curses. He's running late. He has to deliver a package to the monastery on the other side of the mountain, and it's already getting dark. Wang knows the monks don't like visitors after dark, but he has no choice. He starts down the path, picking his way carefully in the twilight. As he approaches the monastery, he can see lights shining in the windows. He quickens his pace, but before he can reach the door, it swings open and a figure cloaked in black appears. Wang stops in his tracks, heart pounding. The figure beckons to him, and Wang hesitantly follows. He is led into the monastery, where he is greeted by the abbot. The abbot tells Wang that he has been expecting him. Wang is relieved, and the abbot leads him to the dining hall, where a warm meal is waiting. After dinner, the abbot shows Wang to his room and tells him to get some rest. Wang is tired from his long journey, and he quickly falls asleep. In the morning, he will be given the package to deliver.
