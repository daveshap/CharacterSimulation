Mashawn had always enjoyed watching the sun set over the ocean. There was something about the way the light danced on the waves that always calming to him. Tonight, he was watching the sunset from a quiet beach in Asia. He had been working on a construction project in the area for the past few months and was finally able to take a few days off. As he watched the sun dip below the horizon, he felt a sense of peace wash over him. It was nice to just sit and relax, without having to worry about work or anything else. He was so lost in thought that he didn't hear someone approach from behind. "Excuse me, sir?" Mashawn turned to see a young woman standing there. She was holding a small bag in one hand and a camera in the other. "Do you mind if I take a picture of you?" she asked. Mashawn was a bit surprised, but he didn't mind. He posed for a few pictures as the woman snapped away. "Thank you so much!" she said when she was finished. "Have a nice evening." Mashawn watched her walk away before turning back to the ocean. The sun was almost completely gone now, but the waves were still glimmering in the waning light. He took a deep breath and felt his worries start to melt away. It was going to be a good night.
