The moon is a beautiful, serene place. The sky is a deep, rich blue, and the stars shine bright. The air is still and cool. Gabbi is a babysitter who is watching over a group of children. They are all playing together happily, running and chasing each other around. Gabbi is keeping a close eye on them, making sure they stay safe. As dusk starts to fall, the children begin to get tired. Gabbi gathers them all up and leads them back to their home. They say goodbye to the moon and the stars, and Gabbi tucks them all into bed. It's been a long day, but Gabbi is happy to have spent it with the children. They are all so sweet and innocent. She knows they will have many more adventures together, on the moon and beyond.
