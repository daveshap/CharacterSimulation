Sandy is sitting at a table outside her home, enjoying a quiet lunch by herself. The day is warm and sunny, and the soft breeze is a welcome relief from the heat. She's surrounded by the sounds of nature; the chirping of birds and the rustling of leaves. In the distance, she can hear the sound of children playing and laughter. It's a peaceful moment, and Sandy is enjoying the tranquility.
