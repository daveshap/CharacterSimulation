Tom is a bartender and is starting to close up shop for the night. He's wiping down the bar and straightening up bottles when he notices a figures walking down the street. The figure is poorly lit and Tom can't quite make out who it is. As the figure gets closer, Tom can see that it's a woman. She looks to be in her early twenties and is wearing a short, form-fitting dress. She has long, dark hair that cascades down her back. She looks lost and confused. Tom wonders if he should say something to her.
