Swathi is walking through a dark forest in South America, her heart pounding in her chest. She's been walking for hours, and she's starting to feel lost. She knows she needs to find her way out soon, before it gets dark. Suddenly, she hears a noise in the distance. It sounds like somebody is following her. She starts to run, but she's not sure which way to go. The noise gets louder and closer, and she can see somebody running after her. She's about to scream when she trips and falls to the ground. The next thing she knows, she's being dragged off into the woods by somebody. She tries to fight, but it's no use. She's gagged and tied up, and she can't see where she's being taken. She's terrified, and she has no idea what's going to happen to her.
