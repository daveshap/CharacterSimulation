The sun is just starting to peek over the mountaintops as Aleksy makes his way up the winding path. He stops for a moment to take in the view- the valley below him is blanketed in a thin layer of mist, and the first rays of sunlight are starting to filter through. As he continues on his way, he hears the sound of birdsong in the distance. He rounds a corner and comes upon a small clearing, where a family of deer are grazing. He stops to watch them for a moment before continuing on his way. He finally reaches the top of the mountain, where a small stone hut stands. He goes inside and lights a fire in the stove, then begins to prepare breakfast. As he works, he looks out the window at the breathtaking view of the valley below.
