The sky is just starting to lighten up, and the Eifel Tower looms large against the background of the Paris skyline. Sandy is standing at the base of the tower, looking up at it with a sense of wonder. She's never been to Paris before, and the sight of the tower is truly breathtaking. She can hear the sounds of the city starting to come to life all around her - cars honking, people talking, and the sound of a distant siren. The air is cold and crisp, and Sandy can see her breath in the air. She's here with her husband and two young children, who are still asleep in the hotel room. Sandy knows they'll be up soon, and she wants to make the most of this moment before the day gets started. She stands there for a few minutes, taking in the sights and sounds of the city, before heading back to the hotel to wake her family up.
