It's a quiet night at the bar. Tom is wiping down the counter, waiting for customers. The door opens and a few people come in. They sit down at the counter and Tom greets them. He asks them what they'll be having and gets them their drinks. They chat for a bit and then leave. Tom goes back to cleaning the counter.
