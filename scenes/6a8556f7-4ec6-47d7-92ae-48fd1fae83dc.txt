Wang is a delivery driver who has just finished his shift. He is exhausted from a long day of driving and is looking forward to going home to his family. He walks to his car, which is parked under the Eiffel Tower, and is about to get in when he sees a group of people approaching. The group is composed of a few men and women of various ages, all of whom look tired and worn down. Wang recognizes one of the men as a regular customer at the restaurant where he works. The man, who is carrying a large backpack, stops in front of Wang and looks him in the eye. "I need your help," the man says. "We're trying to get to the top of the Eiffel Tower, but we don't have enough money to buy tickets. Can you spare some change?" Wang looks at the group and sees the desperation in their eyes. He knows that it would be dangerous for them to try to climb the tower without tickets, so he decides to help them. He reaches into his pocket and takes out all the money he has. "Here," he says, handing the money to the man. "This should be enough to get you to the top." The man thanks Wang profusely, and the group starts to make their way towards the tower. Wang watches them go, hoping that they will make it to the top safely.
