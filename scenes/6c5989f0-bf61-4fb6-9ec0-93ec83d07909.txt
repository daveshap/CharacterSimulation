Aleksy had just gotten home from his shift at the grocery store and was famished. He went to the fridge and grabbed a left over sandwich from the day before and headed to his bedroom to eat. He turned on the TV and sat down on his bed to eat and watch his favorite soap opera. He was half way through his sandwich when he started to feel drowsy. He turned off the TV and laid down, sandwich in hand, and promptly fell asleep.
