Bob had been walking for hours, it seemed like days. He had been walking since he had last seen the light of day. His feet were blistered and sore, his throat was parched and dry. He had not eaten in days. He had been walking in circles for hours, it seemed like days. He had been walking since he had last seen the light of day. His feet were blistered and sore, his throat was parched and dry. He had not eaten in days. He was lost. He had been walking in circles for hours, it seemed like days. He had been walking since he had last seen the light of day. His feet were blistered and sore, his throat was parched and dry. He had not eaten in days. He was lost. He sits down on a tree stump to rest. He is exhausted. He closes his eyes and drifts off to sleep. He is woken up by a rustling in the bushes. He stands up and draws his knife. He is ready to fight. From the bushes, a small animal emerges. Bob relaxes and puts his knife away. He is relieved. He scoops up the animal and continues walking. He is hoping to find his way out of the forest soon.
