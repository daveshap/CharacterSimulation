The sun is setting behind the mountains, and Gabbi is sitting on a bench, watching the clouds change color. She's been babysitting the kids all day, and they're finally asleep. She's tired, but she can't help but feel grateful for this moment of peace. The air is cool and fresh, and she can see the whole valley below. She takes a deep breath and lets her mind wander.
