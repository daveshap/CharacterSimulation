Jenna is walking through a Savanna-like environment in Africa. She's wearing a light tank top and shorts, and is carrying a water bottle and a small backpack. She's sweating profusely and is extremely hot. She's walking quickly, trying to find some shade. She sees a large tree up ahead and quickens her pace. But as she gets closer, she realizes that there's already someone there, sitting in the shade. Jenna slows down, not wanting to intrude. But as she gets closer, she recognizes the person as her old friend from high school, Sarah. Jenna quickens her pace again, now eager to catch up with her old friend. "Sarah! What are you doing here?" Jenna asks as she approaches. "Hi Jenna! I'm on a gap year, traveling before I start college," Sarah replies. The two old friends chat for a while, catching up on what they've been doing since they last saw each other. Jenna tells Sarah about her plans to go to college next year, and Sarah tells Jenna about her travels. eventually stand up and say goodbye to each other, promising to keep in touch. Jenna continues on her walk, now feeling much cooler thanks to the shade provided by the tree.
