Wang is driving his delivery truck up a winding mountain road in the dead of night. His headlights cut through the darkness, illuminating the endlessly twisting road ahead. His destination is a small village perched atop the mountain, and he knows that he needs to be careful not to miss the turnoff. As he nears the top of the mountain, the road becomes even narrower and more treacherous. Wang's truck scrapes against the cliffside at one point, sending a shower of rocks tumbling down into the darkness below. Finally, he reaches the turnoff and begins the descent into the village. The village is dark and sleepy at this hour, and Wang has no trouble finding the address he's looking for. He brings the truck to a stop in front of a small cottage and honks his horn to wake the occupants. A light comes on inside, and a moment later the door opens to reveal a sleepy-eyed man in his nightclothes. The man signs for the package and takes it inside, leaving Wang to drive back down the mountain and onto the next delivery.
