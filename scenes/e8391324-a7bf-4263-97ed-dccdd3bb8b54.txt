Bob the coffee shop owner is on the moon, in the middle of the night. He's all alone, and he's got a big pot of coffee brewing. He's got a few chairs and a table set up, and he's just waiting for customers. He's been on the moon for a few weeks now, and business has been slow. He's starting to wonder if maybe he made a mistake in opening up shop here. But he's not ready to give up just yet. He's decided to stay open all night, in hopes that someone will come by. He's not sure who or what he's expecting, but he's hopeful nonetheless. He's got the coffee brewing and the chairs set out, and he's just waiting. He's not sure what the night will bring, but he's ready for it.
