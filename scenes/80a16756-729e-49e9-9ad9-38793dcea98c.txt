The sun is just peeking over the horizon, casting a pale pink and orange glow over the city. Swathi is hurrying to catch her train to work. She's wearing a tailored navy suit and carrying a laptop bag over her shoulder. The streets are still relatively empty at this hour, but Swathi knows that won't last long. She quickens her pace, crossing the street and darting down an alleyway that will take her to the train station. She can hear the sound of traffic starting to build up on the main streets and the occasional honk of a horn. The fresh morning air feels good as she walks, and she can't help but feel a sense of excitement for the day ahead. She's been working on a new project at the office and is anxious to get started on it. As she rounds the corner into the train station, she spots her train pulling in. She quickens her pace even more, sprinting towards the platform. She makes it just in time, leaping onto the train as the doors are closing. She finds a seat and settles in for the ride, her mind already starting to race with ideas for the project.
