The forest is eerily quiet as Bob makes his way through the trees. He has been walking for hours and is now quite lost. His only hope is to find his way back to the coffee shop where he left his phone. He knows his wife will be worried about him. Suddenly, Bob hears a branch snap behind him. He whips around, heart pounding, but there is nothing there. He is sure he is being watched but can't see anything in the dense foliage. He starts to walk again, faster this time, but the feeling of being followed persists. His heart is racing now and he is having trouble catching his breath. He breaks into a run, but whatever is following him is keeping pace. Bob can hear heavy footfalls now and something crashing through the underbrush behind him. He is about to be caught. He stumbles and falls to the ground as whatever is chasing him catches up. Bob looks up to see a large, furry creature standing over him. It is a chimpanzee, and it looks angry. Bob is terrified as the chimpanzee snatches him up in its powerful arms and begins to drag him deeper into the forest.
