Bob is a coffee shop owner who lives on the moon. His coffee shop is the only one on the moon, and he's been in business for about a year. He's doing pretty well, but he's always looking for ways to improve his business. Tonight, Bob is staying open a little later than usual. He's hoping that some of the night shift workers will come in for a cup of coffee before they head home. Around 6pm, a few of the night shift workers start to trickle into the coffee shop. Bob greets them all with a smile and offers them their favorite coffee drinks. The night shift workers are happy to have a place to relax and chat before they head home. As the night goes on, more and more night shift workers come into the coffee shop. Bob keeps them all entertained with stories and jokes. He knows most of them by name, and they all seem to enjoy his company. By the end of the night, Bob is tired but happy. He's glad he decided to stay open late, because he's made a lot of new friends.
