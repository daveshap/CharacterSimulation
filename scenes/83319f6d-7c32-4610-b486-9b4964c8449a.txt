Wang is driving his delivery truck through the city streets. He makes a few turns and then stops at a red light. He looks around and sees the bright lights of the city all around him. He hears the sound of cars honking and people talking. The light turns green and he starts to drive again. He makes a few more turns and then arrives at his destination, a large delivery warehouse. He parks the truck and gets out. He goes to the back of the truck and opens the door. He starts to unload the boxes of food that he has delivered.
