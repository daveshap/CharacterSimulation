The concert is in full swing, with the band playing their hearts out on stage. The crowd is cheering and singing along to the music, making it feel like one big party. Swathi is standing in the middle of it all, smiling and enjoying herself. She feels a sense of joy and excitement from being surrounded by so much positive energy. Every now and then, she catches someone's eye and they share a moment of connection before getting lost in the music again.
