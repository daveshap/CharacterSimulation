Sandy is sitting in her hut, surrounded by her five children. It's been a long day and she's exhausted, but she knows she has to stay up a little longer to make sure her little ones are all fed and tucked in for the night. She starts a small fire in the center of the hut and begins to cook the evening meal. Her children watch eagerly as the pot of stew begins to simmer. Sandy ladles out bowls of steaming stew for her children and they all sit down to eat. As they eat, Sandy tells her children stories about her own childhood in Africa. She talks about the animals she used to see and the adventures she used to have. Her children listen raptly, their eyes wide with wonder. Eventually, Sandy tucks her children into bed, one by one. She kisses each of them goodnight, and tells them she loves them. Sandy then sits down by the fire to enjoy a few moments of peace before she, too, goes to bed. She gazes into the flames, lost in thought, until she finally falls asleep.
