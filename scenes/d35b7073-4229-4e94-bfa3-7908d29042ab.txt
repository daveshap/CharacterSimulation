Jenna was in her office building, working on some homework. It was getting dark outside, and she was starting to get tired. She decided to take a break and went to the window to look out. The office building was in the city, and she could see the lights of the skyline. The sun was setting, and the sky was a beautiful orange. She watched the people walking on the street below and the cars driving by. She felt a sudden jolt and realized that the building was shaking. She heard screams and people running. She grabbed her backpack and ran out of the office. The building was collapsing. Jenna ran as fast as she could, but the debris was falling all around her. She was hit by a piece of concrete and knocked to the ground. She tried to get up, but she couldn't move. She was trapped.
