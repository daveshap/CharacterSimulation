Jenna is walking on the surface of the moon, enjoying the evening air. She's wearing a suit that protects her from the harsh environment and her helmet has a tinted visor to keep the bright sun out of her eyes. Jenna is carrying a backpack with her supplies for the journey. She's been walking for hours, and she's getting tired. Jenna stops to rest for a few minutes, sitting on a large rock. She takes a drink of water from her canteen and looks up at the stars. Jenna can't believe she's really here on the moon. It's something she's always dreamed of doing, and she's finally made it. Jenna gets up and starts walking again. She's not sure how much further she has to go, but she knows she'll find her way. After a while, she comes to a small crater. Jenna climbs down into the crater and starts to explore. She finds some interesting rocks and takes some pictures. Jenna is having the time of her life. Suddenly, Jenna hears a noise. She turns around and sees a large, dark creature standing at the edge of the crater, watching her. Jenna is terrified and doesn't know what to do. The creature starts to walk towards her, and Jenna backs away. She trips over a rock and falls, hitting her head on the ground. Jenna passes out. When she wakes up, Jenna is inside a spaceship. She has no idea how she got there. She sees the creature that took her and it's not scary anymore. In fact, it looks kind of friendly. Jenna is surprised, but she's not scared. She knows she's safe now.
