Tom enters his bedroom and immediately begins to undress. He starts with his shirt, pulling it off his head and throwing it onto the bed. Next, he unbuttons his pants and shimmies out of them, leaving them in a heap on the floor. He walks to the bed and climbs in, pulling the covers up to his chest. He stares up at the ceiling, lost in thought. After a few minutes, he hears a noise from the other room. It sounds like someone is moving around in the kitchen. He gets out of bed and quietly walks to the door, listening intently. He can hear the sound of cabinets opening and closing, and the telltale clink of dishes being moved around. Tom knows that his roommate, Sarah, is home from her night shift at the hospital. She must be getting something to eat. He hesitates for a moment, wondering if he should say something to her. But he decides against it and quietly goes back to bed.
