Jenna awoke to the sun beaming in through her bedroom window. She lazily got out of bed, feeling well-rested after sleeping in. She made her way downstairs, where she found her mother in the kitchen making lunch. Jenna sat down at the table and chatted with her mother while she ate. After lunch, Jenna decided to go for a walk. She stepped outside and inhaled the fresh air, feeling grateful to be able to spend the afternoon exploring the nature that surrounded her home. She walked for a while, taking in the sights and sounds of the birds and the breeze. eventually made her way back to the cottage. She walked in the front door and was met with the smell of her mother's baking. She smiled and went to enter the kitchen, but was stopped short by a noise coming from the living room. Jenna cautiously approached the living room, wondering if there was an intruder in her home. As she entered the room, she saw a figure in the shadows. Jenna's heart began to race as she tried to figure out what to do. The figure spoke, and Jenna realized that it was just her father, home from work early. Jenna laughed in relief and rushed to embrace her father.
