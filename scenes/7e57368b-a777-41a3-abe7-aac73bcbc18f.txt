It's early morning, and the sun is just starting to peek through the trees. Gabbi, a babysitter, is walking through a dark forest in South America, holding a baby in her arms. She's been walking for hours, and she's getting tired. The baby is getting fussy, and Gabbi is getting scared. She's not sure where she is, or how she's going to get out of the forest. She keeps walking, hoping to find a way out.
