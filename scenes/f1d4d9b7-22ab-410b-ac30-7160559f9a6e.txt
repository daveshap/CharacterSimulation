Sandy is sitting at her kitchen table, enjoying a quiet moment to herself during her kids' lunch time. She's eating a simple sandwich and gazing out the window at the lunar landscape. It's a beautiful day on the moon, and Sandy can't help but feel a sense of peace and contentment. Suddenly, the door burst open and her two young children come running in, laughing and shouting. They're both covered in dust from playing outside, and Sandy can't help but smile at the sight. After lunch, Sandy takes her kids out for a walk around their lunar home. They explore the craters and cliffs, marveling at the strange and beautiful landscape. The sun is starting to set, and Sandy can't help but feel grateful for this moment of peace and wonder.
