Aleksy, a grocery store clerk, was on his lunch break on a mountaintop in Europe. Mid-afternoon, the sun was shining and the breeze was blowing. Aleksy was enjoying the view when he heard a noise. He looked over and saw a rock slide coming down the mountain. He had just enough time to get out of the way before the rocks came tumbling down.
