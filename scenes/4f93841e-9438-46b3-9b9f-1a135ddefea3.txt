The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the cityscape. The streets are already teeming with people rushing to get to work or school. Among them is Sandy, a stay-at-home mom who is out for a morning walk with her baby in a stroller. She savors the peace and quiet of the early morning, enjoying the sights and sounds of the city coming to life. The fresh air feels good after being cooped up indoors all day with her toddler. As she rounds a corner, she sees a commotion up ahead and slows down to see what's going on. A group of people are gathered around a newsstand,reading the latest headlines. Sandy can't help but overhear snippets of their conversation. "Can you believe it? Another terrorist attack in London." "I know. I'm scared to even fly anymore." "These crazy Muslims are going to ruin the world." Sandy quickens her pace, not wanting to get caught up in their worrisome conversation. She has enough to worry about with a young child at home. She doesn't need to add international terrorism to her list of concerns.
