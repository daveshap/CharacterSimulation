It was mid-afternoon on the moon. Gabbi was a babysitter who was taking care of a group of children. They were playing in the sand and Gabbi was watching them. Suddenly, one of the children started to cry. Gabbi went over to see what was wrong. The child said that he was hungry. Gabbi didn't have any food with her, so she had to go to the nearest store to buy some.
