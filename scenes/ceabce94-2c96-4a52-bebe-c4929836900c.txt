Bob is in his bedroom, sitting at his desk with his laptop open in front of him. He's munching on a sandwich as he reads something on the screen. Suddenly, his phone rings and he answers it. "Hey, what's up?" he says into the phone. He listens for a moment, then his face breaks into a smile. "That's great news! I'll be right there." He hangs up the phone and starts to get up from his desk, but his cat winds itself around his legs, meowing for attention. Bob stoops down to give the cat a quick pat, then hurries out of the room.
