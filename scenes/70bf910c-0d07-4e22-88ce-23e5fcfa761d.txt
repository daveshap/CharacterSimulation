Gabbi finishes her last night shift for the week and is eagerly looking forward to her weekend. It's a slow night, so she's had plenty of time to catch up on her schoolwork and she's almost finished her shift. Suddenly, she hears a noise coming from one of the other rooms in the office building. Gabbi tries to ignore it, but it's getting louder and more persistent. She's pretty sure that there's someone in the building and they're trying to break in. Gabbi starts to feel a little scared, but she knows she needs to find out what's going on. She cautiously approaches the source of the noise and peeks around the corner. She sees a man trying to pry open the door to the office building. The man sees Gabbi and starts to run towards her. Gabbi scream and runs the other way. She knows she needs to find somewhere to hide. She runs into one of the offices and locks the door behind her. She can hear the man trying to open the door, but thankfully it holds. Gabbi calls the police and waits for them to arrive. She's shaken, but relief washes over her when she sees the police pulling up to the office building.
