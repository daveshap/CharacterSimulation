Sandy is a stay-at-home mom who lives on the moon. She is out for a walk at dusk, enjoying the quiet of the evening. The sky is a deep blue, and the stars are just beginning to come out. Sandy feels a sense of peace and calm as she walks. Suddenly, Sandy hears a noise behind her. She turns to see a large, furry creature standing there. The creature is menacing, and Sandy feels scared. She starts to back away, but the creature starts to come towards her. Sandy starts to run, but the creature is faster. It catches up to her and knocks her to the ground. Sandy feels a sharp pain in her leg and looks down to see the creature's teeth sunk into her flesh. Sandy screams for help, but nobody comes. The creature starts to drag her away. Sandy knows she is going to die. She thinks of her husband and children and how much she loves them. Suddenly, the creature is hit by a beam of light. It drops Sandy and falls to the ground, dead. Sandy looks up to see a spaceship overhead. A voice comes over the loudspeaker, telling her that she has been rescued. Sandy is taken aboard the spaceship and given medical treatment. She is safe now, but she will never forget the terror of that night on the moon.
