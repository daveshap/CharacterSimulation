Jenna wakes up slowly, the early morning light filtering in through her bedroom window. She rubs her eyes and stretches, then swings her legs out of bed and stands up. She stretches again, yawning, then goes over to her dresser and begins to get dressed for the day. She puts on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt, then goes over to her mirror to brush her hair. She ties it back into a ponytail, then goes over to her bedroom door and opens it, stepping out into the hallway.
