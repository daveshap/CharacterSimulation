Mashawn is working on a construction site in Africa. It's a hot, dusty day and he's sweating profusely. He's operating a jackhammer, breaking up concrete. The noise is deafening. He stops for a break and wipes the sweat from his brow. He takes a sip of water from his canteen and looks around. He sees the other workers, some operating machinery, some lugging heavy loads of materials. He hears a loud roar and looks up to see a lion walking across the site. Everyone stops what they're doing and watches as the lion calmly strolls through the construction site. After a few minutes, the lion moves on and everyone goes back to work. Mashawn picks up his jackhammer and resumes breaking up the concrete.
