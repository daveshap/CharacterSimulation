The sun is setting behind the mountains, and Bob is watching from his coffee shop. He's got a good view of the valley below, and he can see the lights starting to come on in the homes and businesses down there. It's a peaceful scene, and Bob feels lucky to be able to live and work in such a beautiful place. As he's watching, Bob sees a figures come over the top of the mountain and start down the other side. It's a hiker, he assumes, out for a evening walk. He watches the figure for a while, until they disappear out of view. A few minutes later, Bob sees another figure come over the top of the mountain. This one is moving much faster than the first, and Bob can see that they're carrying something. It looks like a backpack, and they're headed down the mountain at a pretty good clip. Bob wonders if the second hiker is chasing the first, or if they're just in a hurry to get somewhere. Bob continues to watch the mountain, but he doesn't see any more hikers. After a few minutes, he goes back to work, cleaning up the shop for the night.
