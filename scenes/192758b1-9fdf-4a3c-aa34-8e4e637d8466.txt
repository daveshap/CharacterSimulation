Bob is a coffee shop owner who is in his bedroom on a mid-afternoon. He is lying on his bed with his eyes closed, and he is thinking about his day. He is thinking about how he needs to go to the store to get more coffee beans, and he is also thinking about how he needs to clean his shop. He is thinking about how he wants to talk to his customers and get to know them better. He is also thinking about how he needs to hire a new barista.
