The sun is beginning to set over the African plains, casting a beautiful orange hue in the sky. The temperature is beginning to cool down, making it the perfect time to enjoy a drink. Inside the safari lodge, Tom is busy mixing drinks for the guests. He hums to himself as he works, lost in his own world. The lodge is full of people chatting and laughing, enjoying the peace of the wilderness. The air is thick with the smell of alcohol and perfume. As the night goes on, Tom gets more and more busy. He chats and jokes with the guests, serving them drink after drink. The atmosphere is electric and everyone is having a great time. Tom is in his element, making sure everyone has a good time. Eventually, the lodge starts to quiet down as people head to bed. Tom finishes up his shift and head to his own room, tired but happy.
