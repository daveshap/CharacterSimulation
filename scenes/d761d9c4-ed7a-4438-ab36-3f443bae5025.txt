Aleksy is working at his grocery store early in the morning, before the sun has even risen. He's stocking shelves and getting things ready for the day. Suddenly, he hears a loud noise from outside. He looks out the window and sees the Eiffel Tower falling over! Aleksy drops everything and runs outside to see if anyone is hurt. He sees people running and screaming everywhere. He looks up at the tower and sees that it's about to fall on him! He runs away as fast as he can and narrowly misses being crushed by the fallen structure.
