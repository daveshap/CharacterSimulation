Sandy is lounging on the lunar surface, enjoying the quiet of the evening. She's been looking forward to this all day - her husband is working the night shift and the kids are finally in bed. It's nice to have some time to herself. She gazes up at the stars, marveling at the way they seem so much brighter here on the moon. She remembers the first time she saw them, on her honeymoon. It feels like a lifetime ago. She's glad they decided to move out here - it's been good for the whole family. Suddenly, she hears a noise. It sounds like someone is coming. She gets up and dusts herself off, heart racing. She knows she shouldn't be out here by herself - it's against the rules. But she can't help but be curious. She peers around a nearby crater and sees a man walking towards her. He's wearing a spacesuit and carrying a rifle. Sandy swallows hard, not sure what to do. She's about to call out to him when he raises the rifle and points it at her. Sandy freezes, terror gripping her. She knows she's in trouble now. The man starts to speak, but his words are garbled. Sandy can't understand what he's saying. He takes a step closer and she backs away. Suddenly, he opens fire. Sandy screams as she feels the bullets tearing into her. She collapses to the ground, dead. The man walks away, leaving her body behind.
