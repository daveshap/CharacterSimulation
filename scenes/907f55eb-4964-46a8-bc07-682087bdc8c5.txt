Wang is driving his delivery truck on a dirt road in Africa. It is evening, and the sun is setting. He is delivers goods to a small village. As he approaches, he sees a group of children playing in the dirt. They stop and stare at him as he drives by. He waves to them and they wave back. He then sees a group of women walking along the road. They are carrying bundles of firewood on their heads. He honks his horn as he passes them. As he nears the village, he sees a group of men sitting in the shade of a tree. They are drinking beer and laughing. Wang honks his horn at them as he passes. He then arrives at the village. He delivers his goods to the storekeeper and then drives back to the main road.
