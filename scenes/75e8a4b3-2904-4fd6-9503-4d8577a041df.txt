It's a beautiful day outside, and Sandy is enjoying a leisurely lunch on the porch of her country cottage. She's surrounded by a peaceful garden, and the warm sun is shining down on her. She's enjoying a sandwich and a glass of iced tea, and she's feeling happy and content. Suddenly, she hears a loud noise coming from the direction of the road. She gets up to see what's going on, and she sees a car speeding down the road, followed by a police car with its sirens blaring. The car speeds past her cottage, and Sandy can see that the driver is a young woman, and she looks panicked. The police car follows close behind, and Sandy watches as the two vehicles disappear down the road. Sandy goes back to her lunch, and she can't help but wonder what the young woman was doing that was so bad that she needed to flee from the police. She wonders if she'll ever find out what happened.
