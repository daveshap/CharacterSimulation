Gabbi is sitting on the porch of a small hut, watching over a group of sleeping children. The night is warm and the air is filled with the sounds of insects and animals. Gabbi iszone, her eyes scanning the darkness for any sign of danger. She knows that lions sometimes roam this part of Africa, and she does not want any of the children to be harmed. Suddenly, Gabbi hears a rustling in the bushes. She tensed, her heart racing as she prepared to defend the children. However, instead of a lion, a small rabbit hopped out from the undergrowth. Gabbi let out a sigh of relief and relaxed back into her chair. She continued to watch over the children, her mind drifting back to her own childhood in Africa. She remembers the nights she would sit on her porch, watching over her little brothers and sisters as they slept. She would always be on the lookout for any danger, ready to protect her loved ones. Gabbi feels a deep sense of love and protectiveness for the children she is watching over tonight. She knows that they are safe in her care, and she will do whatever it takes to keep them safe.
