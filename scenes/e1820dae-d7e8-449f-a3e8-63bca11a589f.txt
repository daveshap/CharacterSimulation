Jenna was walking through the forest, listening to the sounds of the animals and the crunch of leaves under her feet. It was getting dark, and she knew she needed to find a place to camp for the night. She had seen some caves earlier in the day and decided to head back in that direction. As she approached the caves, she could hear strange noises coming from inside. It sounded like someone was crying. Jenna didn't want to go in, but she felt like she had to. She slowly made her way into the cave, calling out to whoever was there. When she entered the main chamber of the cave, she saw a girl huddled in the corner, crying. Jenna went over to her and asked what was wrong. The girl, who was shaking and shaking, related her story. She said that she and her friends had been hiking in the forest when they were attacked by some men. They were tied up and brought to this cave, where the men had been keeping them captive for days. Jenna asked if the men were still there, and the girl said she didn't know, that they had been taken out earlier and hadn't come back. Jenna untied the girl and told her they were going to find a way out of the cave. She grabbed a torch from the wall and started leading the way, but she didn't get far before she heard the sound of footsteps coming towards them. Jenna panicked and tried to hide, but it was too late. The men had found them.
