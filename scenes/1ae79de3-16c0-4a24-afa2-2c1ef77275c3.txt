The sun was setting behind her, and the cool breeze was blowing through her hair. She sat on the edge of the quiet beach, watching the waves crash against the shore. The sky was a beautiful orange, and the stars were shining. She sighed and stood up, brushing the sand off her legs. She was about to go back to her hotel when she saw something in the water. It was a turtle! She smiled and walked over to it, picking it up and putting it back in the sea.
