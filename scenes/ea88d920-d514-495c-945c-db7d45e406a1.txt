Mashawn is walking through the jungle, trying to find his way back to camp. He is sweating and panting, and his heart is pounding in his chest. He can hear the sounds of animals all around him, and he is getting scared. Suddenly, he hears a loud roar and sees a lion in front of him. He starts to run, but the lion is faster and catches up to him. Mashawn feels the lion's teeth sink into his flesh and he screams in pain. He knows he is going to die.
