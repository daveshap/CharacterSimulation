It's the middle of the night, and Sandy is alone in the office building. She's a stay-at-home mom, and she's been coming here to work on her resume and job search for the past few months. She's gotten pretty good at sneaking in after everyone has gone home for the night. Tonight, Sandy is sitting at her desk, working on her computer. She's been up for a few hours, and she's starting to get tired. She's just about to call it a night when she hears a noise coming from the other side of the room. Sandy freezes, listening to the noise. It sounds like someone is moving around in the other room. Sandy is terrified, and she doesn't know what to do. She slowly gets up from her desk, trying to be as quiet as possible. She creeps toward the door to the other room, listening for the noise. When she gets to the door, she hesitates for a moment, then opens it slowly. Peeking into the other room, Sandy sees a man rummaging through some papers on a desk. The man hasn't seen her, and Sandy is relieved. She's about to turn and run when the man suddenly looks up and sees her. He freezes for a moment, then starts to run toward her. Sandy screams and runs back into the office, slamming the door shut behind her. She presses her back against the door, trying to hold it shut, but the man is pounding on it, trying to get in. Sandy is terrified, and she doesn't know what to do. She looks around the room for a way to escape, but the only way out is the door that the man is trying to get through. Sandy is trapped.
