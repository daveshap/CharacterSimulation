The sun is shining and the birds are singing. Jenna is sitting at a table on the porch of her country cottage, enjoying a leisurely lunch. She's got a sandwich and a glass of lemonade, and she's feeling pretty good about life. It's a beautiful day, and she's surrounded by the peace and quiet of the countryside.
