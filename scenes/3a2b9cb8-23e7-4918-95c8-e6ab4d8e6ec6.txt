Gabbi is sitting at her desk in the office, eating her lunch. It's a quiet day, and she's enjoying the peace and quiet. Suddenly, she hears a loud bang from the other side of the building. She gets up to investigate and sees that one of the windows has been broken. She can see a group of people outside, throwing rocks at the building. Gabbi runs back to her desk and calls the police. She then gathers up all the children in the office and brings them into a safe room. She helps them stay calm until the police arrive and the situation is under control.
