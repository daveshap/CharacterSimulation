It's a beautiful day in Africa. The sun is shining and the temperature is perfect. Jenna is sitting on the porch of her school, eating her lunch and enjoying the view. She's surrounded by her classmates, who are chatting and laughing. All of a sudden, a lion appears out of nowhere and starts stalking Jenna. The other students scream and run away, but Jenna is frozen in fear. The lion gets closer and Jenna is sure that she's going to die. But then, something amazing happens. The lion stops and sits down next to Jenna, as if it's trying to comfort her. Jenna slowly relaxes and starts petting the lion. It's an incredible experience that she'll never forget.
