Jenna is walking home from her friend's house late at night. She is alone and the streets are empty. The only sound is the clicking of her heels on the pavement. She is walking quickly, but she is not afraid. She knows these streets like the back of her hand. She turns the corner onto her street and sees a man standing in the shadows, watching her. She doesn't slow down or change her course. She knows he is not going to hurt her. As she passes him, she can feel his eyes on her. She can sense his presence, even though he is not saying or doing anything. She knows he is there, but she does not turn around. She continues walking until she reaches her house. She unlocks the door and goes inside, safe and sound.
