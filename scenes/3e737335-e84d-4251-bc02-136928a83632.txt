Swathi had always wanted to visit the Eifel Tower. She had seen pictures of it online and in movies, and it looked like the most beautiful and romantic place in the world. So when she found out she was going to be in Paris for work, she made sure to schedule some time to go see it. Now, she was standing underneath it, gazing up at its towering glory. The night was cool and clear, and the stars shone bright overhead. Swathi felt a sense of wonder and awe as she looked at the magnificent structure. Suddenly, she heard a noise behind her. She turned around, but there was no one there. She scanned the area, but there was still no one to be seen. Then she heard the noise again, and this time it sounded like footsteps. Swathi's heart began to race as she realized someone was following her. She started to walk quickly, but the footsteps got faster too. Then she began to run, but the footsteps were right behind her. She was about to scream when she felt a hand clamp over her mouth.
