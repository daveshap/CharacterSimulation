Jenna arrives home from school, relieved to be finished with her studies for the day. She enters her cottage and heads straight for the kitchen, where she begins preparing her dinner. She hums softly to herself as she works, content in the peace and quiet of her home. Suddenly, there is a loud crash from outside. Jenna jumps, startled by the noise. She hurriedly goes to the window to see what is happening. Outside, she sees a large buck has crashed into her garden, uprooting her flowers and trampling her vegetables. The buck looks dazed and confused, and Jenna knows it won't be long before it causes more damage. She quickly grabs her shotgun and runs outside, yelling at the buck to try and scare it away. The buck only looks at her, seeming almost defiant, before turning and running off into the woods. Jenna is relieved that the buck is gone but is sadly left with the mess it has made of her garden. She knows it will take weeks of hard work to repair the damage, but she is determined to get her garden back to its former glory.
