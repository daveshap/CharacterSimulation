The sun is setting over the horizon, and the sky is a beautiful orange hue. The waves are crashing against the shore, and the smell of salt water is in the air. Swathi is walking along the beach, admiring the view. She is wearing a white sundress, and her hair is blowing in the wind. She is holding a pink umbrella in one hand and a book in the other. As she walks, she looks down and sees a stranger walking towards her. The stranger is a tall, handsome man. He is wearing a blue button-down shirt and khaki shorts. He has a backpack slung over one shoulder. As he gets closer, Swathi sees that he has a camera in his hand. He smiles at her and says, "Beautiful day, isn't it?" Swathi smiles back and nods. They start talking and soon discover that they have a lot in common. They walk along the beach together, talking and laughing. The sun sets, and the stars come out. Swathi asks the stranger if he wants to sit down and watch the waves. He agrees, and they sit down on the sand. They talk for a while longer, and then the stranger says that he has to go. He thanks Swathi for the conversation and says that he hopes to see her again. Swathi watch him walk away, and then she looks up at the stars and smiles.
