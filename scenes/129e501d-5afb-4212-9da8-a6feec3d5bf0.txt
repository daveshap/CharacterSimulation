Bob steps into his bedroom, yawning and rubbing his tired eyes. He kicks off his shoes and flopping down onto the bed, stretches his arms above his head with a satisfied sigh. The room is fairly small, but cozy with dark green walls and soft lighting. There is a dresser against one wall and a small nightstand by the bed, both cluttered with Bob's things. The bed itself is unmade, the covers thrown back in haste this morning. As Bob lays there, he lets his mind wander back over the events of the day. He remembers the early rush of customers at the coffee shop, the never-ending stream of orders, and the delighted smiles of the customers when they received their drinks. He also remembers the Employee of the Month award he received at the staff meeting this afternoon. Bob smiles to himself, feeling happy and content. It's been a good day, he thinks to himself, and tomorrow is bound to be even better. With that final thought, Bob drift off to sleep, dreaming of the exciting adventures that await him in the coming days.
