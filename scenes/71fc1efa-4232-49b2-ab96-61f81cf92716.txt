Aleksy is working the night shift at the grocery store. He's been stocking shelves and cleaning up the store for the past few hours. It's now getting close to closing time, and Aleksy is starting to feel exhausted. He's just about to finish up his shift when he hears a strange noise coming from the back of the store. Aleksy tries to ignore the noise, but it's getting louder and more persistent. He decides to investigate. As he walks towards the back of the store, the noise gets louder and more distinct. It sounds like someone is trying to break into the store. Aleksy quickly grabs a baseball bat from under the counter and heads towards the noise. He rounds a corner and comes face to face with a man who is trying to break into the store. The man sees Aleksy and starts to run away. Aleksy gives chase, but the man is faster and gets away. Aleksy is frustrated and angry. He knows the man is probably going to try to break into the store again. He decides to call the police and report the incident.
