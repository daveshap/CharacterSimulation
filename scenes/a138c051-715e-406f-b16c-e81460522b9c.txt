Aleksy climbs to the top of the mountain, gasping for breath in the thin air. He reaches the summit just as the sun is setting, painting the sky in a beautiful array of colors. He looks out over the valley below, taking in the sights and sounds of the peaceful countryside. He feels a sense of calm and tranquility wash over him. Suddenly, he hears a noise behind him. He turns to see a large bird swooping down towards him. He tries to run, but the bird is too fast. It grabs him in its claws and lifts him into the air. Aleksy screams as he is carried away into the night.
