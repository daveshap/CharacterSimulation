It's evening, and Tom is bartending at a concert. The concert is in full swing, and the crowd is enjoying the music. Tom is busy making drinks and keeping the guests happy. He's in the middle of a busy shift, but he's loving every minute of it. He loves the music, and he loves seeing the happy faces of the guests.
