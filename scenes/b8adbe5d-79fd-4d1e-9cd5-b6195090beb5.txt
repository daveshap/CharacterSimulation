Jenna was walking along the beach, enjoying the last bit of daylight before it got too dark. The air was still and the waves were crashing gently against the shore. She loved this time of day, when everything seemed so peaceful. Suddenly, she heard a noise behind her and turned around to see a man walking towards her. He looked Asian and was wearing a hoodie, so she couldn't see his face. He was walking quickly and seemed to be carrying something in his hand. Jenna started to feel scared and ran towards the nearest house. The man ran after her and when she looked back, she saw that he had a knife in his hand. She screamed for help, but no one was around. The man caught up to her and pulled her into an alleyway. Jenna begged for her life, but the man didn't say anything. He just stared at her with cold, lifeless eyes. Then, he raised the knife and Jenna felt a sharp pain in her stomach. She collapsed to the ground and everything went black.
