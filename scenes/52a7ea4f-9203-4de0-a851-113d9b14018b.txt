Swathi walks down the street, her mind racing with coding problems she's been trying to solve all day. She's eager to get home and relax, but first she has to stop at the grocery store. The city is alive with energy and Swathi feels a familiar thrill as she steps into the familiar hustle and bustle. She weaves her way through the crowd, dodging people and bags as she makes her way to the store. Inside, she grabs a basket and starts down the aisle, her mind still on her work. She absently throws items into her basket, not really paying attention to what she's doing. She's so lost in thought that she doesn't even notice when she bumps into someone. "Sorry!" she exclaims, finally snapping out of her thoughts. She looks up to see a handsome stranger standing there, a slight smile on his face. For a moment, they just stand there, looking at each other. Then, with a small nod, the stranger moves on and Swathi does the same. She finishes her shopping in a daze, her mind still racing.
