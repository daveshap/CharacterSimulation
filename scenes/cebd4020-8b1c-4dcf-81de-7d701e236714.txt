Sandy is walking through the dark forest, early in the morning. She is carrying a large basket of laundry on her head. She is also carrying her two-year-old daughter, Mia, on her back. Sandy is wearing a long, brightly colored dress and a scarf around her head. She is singing softly to herself as she walks. Suddenly, Sandy hears a noise in the bushes. She stops and listens, but she doesn't see anything. She starts to walk again, but the noise gets louder. This time, she sees a large snake slithering towards her. Sandy screams and tries to run away, but the snake is too fast. It wraps itself around her leg and starts to squeeze. Sandy falls to the ground, still screaming. Mia starts to cry. Sandy tries to reach for her daughter, but the snake is constricting her body. She can't move. The snake tightens its grip and Sandy stops screaming. Her body goes limp and she dies. Mia continues to cry, until she finally falls asleep from exhaustion.
