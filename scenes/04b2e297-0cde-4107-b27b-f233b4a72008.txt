The Eifel Tower stands imposingly against the darkening sky, its arched metal frame illuminated by twinkling lights. Jenna walks underneath it, her heart pounding in her chest. She's never been this close to the Eiffel Tower before and she can't believe she's finally here. She looks up at the towering structure and feels a sense of awe. As she continues to walk, she notices a group of people off to the side, huddled around a small fire. They look rough and dirty, and she can see their breath in the cold air. Tentatively, she approaches them. "Excuse me, do you speak English?" she asks. One of the men looks up at her and nods. "Yes, we do." Jenna lets out a sigh of relief. "I'm looking for a place to stay for the night. Do you know of any cheap hotels around here?" The man shakes his head. "No, sorry. We don't really know the area too well." Jenna's heart sinks. She's been walking around for hours and she's exhausted. She doesn't know what she's going to do. Just then, one of the women speaks up. "You can stay with us, if you want," she says, motioning to the ground next to her. "We have an extra blanket." Jenna hesitates for a moment, but then she nods. "Thank you. I really appreciate it." She sits down next to the woman and huddles under the blanket for warmth. She's never been so grateful in her life. As she stares up at the Eifel Tower, she can't help but feel a sense of wonder. Even though she's cold and exhausted, she knows this is going to be a night she'll never forget.
