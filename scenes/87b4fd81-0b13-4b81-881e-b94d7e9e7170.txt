It's a quiet, sunny day, and Swathi is enjoying a leisurely lunch at her country cottage. She's sitting at the table on the patio, surrounded by a beautiful garden. The table is set with a simple but tasty meal of bread, cheese, and fruit. Swathi is enjoying the fresh air and the peacefulness of the countryside. She's looking forward to spending the afternoon working on her latest project, a new piece of software that she's been working on for her company.
