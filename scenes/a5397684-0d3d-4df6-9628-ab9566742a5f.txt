The sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow across the sky. Jenna stands on the top of a mountain, taking in the breathtaking view. She can see for miles in every direction, the valleys and rivers shimmering in the early morning light. She can even see the tiny villages and farms dotting the landscape. Jenna is here on a school trip, and she's determined to make the most of it. She's already been up to the top of the mountain once, but she wanted to see the sunrise from here. It's something she's always wanted to do, and she knows she'll never get another chance like this. So, here she is, standing on the top of a mountain in Europe, watching the sun come up. It's a moment she knows she'll never forget.
