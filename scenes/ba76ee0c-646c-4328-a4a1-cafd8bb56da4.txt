It's lunch time on the moon, and Swathi is enjoying a meal in the airy, spacious cafeteria. The room is filled with light from the giant windows, and the colorful tables and chairs add a touch of levity to the otherwise sterile environment. Swathi is chatting with her fellow software engineers, joking and laughing about the latest code they're working on. The group is enjoying their break from the grind, but they all know they have to get back to work soon.
