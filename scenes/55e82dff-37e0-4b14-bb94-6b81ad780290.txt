As the sun sets, Aleksy enters his small bedroom in the apartment he shares with several other people. He closes the door behind him and begins to undress, taking off his work clothes and hanging them up neatly. He changes into a pair of comfortable pajamas and climbs into bed, letting out a contented sigh. Aleksy has had a long day at work and is grateful to finally be able to relax. He closes his eyes and soon falls asleep, dreaming of better days to come.
