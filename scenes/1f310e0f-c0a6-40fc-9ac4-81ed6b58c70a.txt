It's a peaceful autumn evening, and Tom is enjoying a quiet evening at his country cottage. The leaves are falling gently from the trees, and the air is filled with the scent of wood smoke. Tom is sitting on his porch, enjoying a glass of wine and listening to the sound of the leaves rustling in the breeze. He's feeling relaxed and content, and he knows that he'll be able to get a good night's sleep tonight.
