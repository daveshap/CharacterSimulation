Gabbi was Millie and John's babysitter. She was in high school and had just turned 17. It was a Saturday night and Gabbi had been babysitting the kids since six o'clock. The kids were in bed and asleep and Gabbi was in the living room watching TV. It was now midnight and Gabbi was getting sleepy. She was just about to turn off the TV and go upstairs to bed when she heard a noise coming from the kitchen. Gabbi got up from the couch and slowly made her way to the kitchen. When she got to the kitchen, she saw that the back door was open and the screen door was swinging back and forth. Gabbi knew that Millie and John never left the doors open like that. She also knew that the kids were asleep upstairs and she would have to go check on them. Gabbi went to the back door and closed it. She then went to the stairs and started to climb them. When she got to the top of the stairs, she heard a noise coming from the room that the kids were in. Gabbi slowly made her way to the room and when she got there, she saw that the window was open. Gabbi went to the window and closed it. Then she went to the kids and made sure they were okay. After she checked on the kids, she went back downstairs and called the police. The police came and they searched the house. They didn't find anything, but they did take a report. Gabbi was relieved that nothing had happened to the kids. She was also glad that she had called the police when she did.
