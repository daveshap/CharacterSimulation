The sun is setting over the horizon, casting a beautiful orange hue in the sky. Jenna is sitting on the porch of her country cottage, watching the colours change as the sun begins to dip below the tree line. She feels a sense of peace and calm wash over her as she takes in the serene scene before her. The birds are singing in the trees and the breeze is gently rustling the leaves. All is right in the world.
