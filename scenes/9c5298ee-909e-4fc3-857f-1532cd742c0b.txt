Mashawn is just finishing up his shift at the construction site. He's been working hard all day, and he's ready to head home. He cleans up his tools and equipment, and then heads to the gate to clock out. As he walks through the gate, he sees the bustling city streets. The sun is just beginning to set, and the city is alive with activity. Cars are honking, people are walking and talking, and the air is filled with the sound of life. Mashawn begins to walk home, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. He smiles to himself, happy to be finished with work for the day.
