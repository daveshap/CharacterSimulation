Swathi is walking through the dark forest, her heart hammering in her chest. She knows she's being followed, but she can't see who it is. Suddenly, a figure jumps out in front of her and she screams. The figure is wearing a mask and is holding a knife. Swathi backs away, but the figure advances on her, knives raised. She's backed up against a tree and there's nowhere to go. The figure slashes at her with the knives and she feels pain as the blade sinks into her flesh. She sinks to the ground, her vision blurring. The last thing she sees is the figure coming towards her, knives raised for the kill.
