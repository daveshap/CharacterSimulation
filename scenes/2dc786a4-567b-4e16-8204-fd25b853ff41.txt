The forest is drenched in darkness, with only a sliver of light filtering through the trees. Swathi is carefully picking her way through the undergrowth, her heart pounding in her chest. She knows she's being followed, and she's terrified of what might happen if she's caught. She can hear the leaves rustling behind her as her pursuer gets closer and closer. She's desperate to find a way out of the forest, but she can't see more than a few feet in front of her. She's running now, blind panic driving her forward. Suddenly, she stumbles and falls, landing hard on the ground. She feels a sharp pain in her leg and knows she can't go any further. She tries to crawl away, but her pursuer is upon her. She feels a cold hand grip her shoulder, and she knows she's going to die.
