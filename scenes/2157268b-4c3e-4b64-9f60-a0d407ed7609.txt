Darkness falls swiftly on the moon, and Tom the bartender is getting ready to close up shop. He's been busy all day serving space tourists and weary astronauts, and is looking forward to getting home to his family. The last few customers trickle out, leaving Tom alone in the bar. He tidies up, washing glasses and wiping down the counter. Finally, he locks the door and heads home, looking up at the stars as he goes.
