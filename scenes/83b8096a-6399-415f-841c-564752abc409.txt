The sun lazily rises over the horizon, casting a warm, orange glow over the landscape. A light breeze briefly ruffles the grass and leaves before dying down again. In the distance, a herd of elephants can be seen peacefully grazing. Closer to where Swathi is standing, a small group of gazelles are calmly drinking from a watering hole. Swathi watches them for a moment before continuing on her walk. She breathe in deeply, taking in the fresh, clean air. It's so different from the polluted air she's used to back home. She feels grateful for the opportunity to be here and experience this amazing place. As she walks, she notices a movement out of the corner of her eye. She turns to see a lioness stalking a nearby Zebra. She holds her breath, not wanting to disturb the natural order of things, and watches as the lioness brings the Zebra down with a single, powerful strike. It's an incredible sight, and one that she'll never forget.
