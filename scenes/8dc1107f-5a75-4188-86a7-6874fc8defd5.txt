Bob stands on the mountaintop, gazing out at the breathtaking view. The sun is just beginning to set, painting the sky in a spectrum of oranges, pinks, and purples. A cool breeze ruffles Bob's hair and he can smell the faintest hint of autumn in the air. He's been coming to this spot for years, ever since he first moved to Europe. It's become his favorite place to come and think, to reflect on his life and all that he's accomplished. He's grateful for his thriving coffee shop business and for the loving family and friends who support him. Standing here on the mountaintop, surrounded by the beauty of nature, Bob feels at peace. He knows that whatever challenges life may bring, he'll be able to face them with strength and courage.
