It was a beautiful day in Paris and Tom was enjoying his afternoon stroll through the city. He walked past the Eiffel Tower and stopped to admire the view. As he looked up at the towering structure, he noticed a young couple kissing in the shadows of the tower. They looked so happy and in love. Tom sighed and continued on his way. He had always wanted to find love like that. He had been searching for his soulmate for years, but hadn't had any luck. Maybe one day he would find his own special someone. But for now, he was content working as a bartender and enjoying the simple things in life.
