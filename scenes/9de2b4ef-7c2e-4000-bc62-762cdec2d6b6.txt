The sun is beating down on the sand, making it hot to the touch. Swathi is walking along the water's edge, admiring the view. The ocean is a deep blue, and the sky is a bright, clear blue. There are some small waves crashing against the shore. Swathi can see some people in the distance, but she is alone for the moment. She is wearing a white sundress and sandals. Her hair is pulled back in a low ponytail. She has a small backpack with her. Suddenly, she hears someone calling her name. She turns to see her friend, Ravi, running towards her. He is wearing shorts and a t-shirt. He has a big smile on his face. "Swathi! I'm so glad I found you!" he says. "Ravi, what are you doing here?" she asks, surprised. "I took a bus down from the city. I wanted to see you!" he says. "That's so sweet of you!" she says, giving him a hug. They walk along the beach, talking and laughing. The wind blows through their hair and the waves crash against the shore. They are happy to be together again.
