Aleksy is working the evening shift at his local grocery store when he gets a call from his boss. She tells him that he can leave early, as there are no more customers and they can close up shop for the night. Aleksy is happy to hear this news, as he was looking forward to getting home to his cozy country cottage. As he locks up the store and heads out to his car, he can't help but notice how beautiful the night sky is. The stars are shining bright and the moon is full. He takes a deep breath of fresh air and feels thankful for this moment of peace. When he arrives home, he is greeted by his cat, who is meowing for food. Aleksy gives her a scoop of food and then heads to the kitchen to make himself a simple dinner. After eating, he settles down in front of the fireplace with a book. As he reads, he can hear the sounds of the animals outside, which makes him feel even more at peace with the world.
