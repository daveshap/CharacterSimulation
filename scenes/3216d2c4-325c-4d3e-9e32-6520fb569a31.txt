Gabbi is sitting on the beach, watching the sunrise with the children she is babysitting. They are all happily chatting and laughing as they enjoy the beautiful morning. The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, painting the sky in a beautiful array of colors. The waves are crashing gently against the shore, and the air is fresh and cool. It's a perfect day for a beach outing.
