It is evening, and Wang, a delivery driver, enters a bedroom. He looks around the room, taking in the various items and pieces of furniture. His eyes settle on a bed in the corner of the room, and he approaches it. He picks up a pillow and sniffles it, then sets it back down. He then moves to the window and looks outside. He see the city skyline, and the many lights twinkling in the distance. He sighs and turns back to the room. He begins to unbutton his shirt, revealing a sweaty and tired body. He takes off his shirt and pants and climbs into the bed. He lets out a long sigh and closes his eyes, soon falling asleep.
