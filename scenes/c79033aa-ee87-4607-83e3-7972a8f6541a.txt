The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon as Sandy steps out onto the porch of her cozy country cottage. The morning air is still and fresh, and the birds are just starting to stir in the trees. Sandy takes a deep breath, and feels the tension of the past few weeks start to dissipate. She's been so busy lately, with the kids and the house and just trying to keep everything together. It feels good to finally have a moment to herself. Sandy walks down the steps and into the garden, admiring the flowers that are just starting to bloom. Suddenly, she hears a noise from the other side of the hedge. It sounds like someone is crying. Sandy hesitates for a moment, unsure of what to do. But then she remembers the time when she was in a similar situation, and how someone had helped her when she needed it most. So Sandy walks around the hedge, and comes face to face with a young woman, who is sobbing uncontrollably. Sandy doesn't know what to say, so she just puts her arms around the woman and lets her cry.
