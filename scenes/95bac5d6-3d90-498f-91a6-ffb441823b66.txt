Sandy is in her bedroom, lying on the bed. She is wearing a loose fitting tank top and shorts. Her hair is pulled back in a messy bun and she has no makeup on. She looks tired and there are dark circles under her eyes. She is scrolling through her phone, mindlessly scrolling through social media. She comes across a post from a friend that shows her friend's happy family on vacation. Sandy's mood immediately changes and she feels a pang of jealousy. She puts her phone down and looks around her bedroom. It is a typical suburban bedroom with beige walls and a dresser with a mirror. There is a clothes hamper in the corner and a door that leads to a small bathroom. Sandy feels like she is trapped in this room. She gets up from the bed and goes to the window. She looks out the window and sees her neighbor's children playing in the yard. She watches them for a few minutes and then turns away from the window, her heart heavy with sadness.
