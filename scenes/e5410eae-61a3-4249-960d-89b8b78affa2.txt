Gabbi is sitting in the bedroom, watching TV. It's the middle of the night, and she's bored. She's been babysitting the kids for hours, and they're finally asleep. She's thinking about going to bed herself, but she's not tired. Suddenly, she hears a noise from downstairs. It sounds like someone is walking around. Gabbi is scared. She doesn't know what to do. She doesn't want to go downstairs and see who it is, but she has to. Slowly, she gets up from the bed and creaks her way downstairs. She's terrified, but she has to see who's there. She reaches the bottom of the stairs and looks into the living room. She sees a figure standing there, and she gasps. The figure is a man, and he's holding a knife. He sees Gabbi and starts to walk towards her. Gabbi is frozen with fear. She doesn't know what to do. The man reaches her and put the knife to her throat. "If you make a sound, I'll kill you," he whispers. Gabbi is terrified. She doesn't know what to do. She's shaking, and she can feel the cold blade of the knife against her skin. The man begins to lead her upstairs, and Gabbi knows she's in trouble. She doesn't know what he's going to do to her, but she's sure it won't be good. She's shaking so badly that she can barely walk, but the man pushes her forward. He leads her into the bedroom where the kids are sleeping. Gabbi is terrified. She doesn't know what he's going to do to her, but she's sure it won't be good.
