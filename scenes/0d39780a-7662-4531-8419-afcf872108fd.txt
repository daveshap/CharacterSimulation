It's dusk, and the last rays of sunlight are filtering through the trees surrounding the cottage. A warm breeze is blowing, and the air is scented with the fragrance of wildflowers. Swathi is sitting on the porch, sipping a cup of tea and watching the fireflies flit about in the meadow. She's feeling content and peaceful, and her worries seem to have melted away. She's been looking forward to this vacation for weeks, and now she's finally able to relax and enjoy herself.
