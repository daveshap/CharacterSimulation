The sun is slowly sinking in the sky, casting a warm glow over the landscape. Jenna is walking through a field, her feet sinking into the soft, spongy ground with each step. She's on her way home from school, and she can't wait to get there. She's been walking for a while, and she's starting to get tired. She's just about to give up and sit down for a rest when she notices something in the distance. At first she can't believe her eyes, but as she gets closer she can see that it's a group of elephants! She's never seen elephants in the wild before, and she's amazed. They're so big and majestic! She watches them for a while, until she realizes that it's getting dark and she needs to get home. As she walks away, she can't help but feel grateful for this special moment that she's just experienced.
