Tom is standing on the beach, looking out at the ocean. It's a beautiful day, and the water is calm and peaceful. He's surrounded by palm trees and the sand is warm and soft. He's wearing a pair of shorts and a t-shirt, and he has a towel around his neck. He's holding a cocktail in one hand. He's been working at the bar all day, and he's ready to relax and enjoy the rest of his afternoon. He takes a sip of his drink and then leans back against a palm tree, closing his eyes and letting the sun wash over him.
