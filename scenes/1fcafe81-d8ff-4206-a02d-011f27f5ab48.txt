The sky is a deep, dark blue, and the sun is just starting to dip below the horizon. Aleksy is standing on the surface of the moon, next to a small grocery store. He's been working there all day, and he's just about to finish his shift. The store is mostly empty, and it's been a slow day. Aleksy is starting to get a little bit restless. He's looking forward to going home and relax. Suddenly, the door to the store opens and a customer walks in. Aleksy greets the customer and asks if he needs any help. The customer doesn't respond, and just starts browsing the shelves. Aleksy is a little bit confused, but he doesn't say anything. He just goes back to his tasks. After a few minutes, the customer comes up to the counter with a few items. Aleksy rings him up and the customer pays. As he's putting the change away, the customer speaks for the first time. "Thank you for your help," he says. "I'm just glad to finally be able to shop on the moon." Aleksy is taken aback. He had no idea that the customer was from the moon. He thanks the customer for his business and watches him leave. He's never seen a customer like that before, and he can't help but wonder what it's like to live on the moon.
