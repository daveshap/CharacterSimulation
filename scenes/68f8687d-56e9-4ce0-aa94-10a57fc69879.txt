Since there's no atmosphere on the moon, the sky is always pitch black. The only light comes from the stars and the occasional spacecraft orbiting overhead. Aleksy is a grocery store clerk who's just finishing up his shift. He's been working all day and is ready to go home. He clocks out and heads towards the airlock. As he steps inside, he feels a sudden jolt as the door seals shut behind him. There's a hissing sound as the air is pumped out of the room. Aleksy starts to feel lightheaded and dizzy. He knows he needs to get to the emergency oxygen tanks, but his body feels so heavy. He tries to take a step forward, but his legs won't move. He falls to the ground, unconscious. The last thing he hears is the alarm sounding as the airlock begins to fill with oxygen.
