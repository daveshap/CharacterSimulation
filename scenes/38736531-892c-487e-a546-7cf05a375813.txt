The scene is set in an office building, early in the morning. Aleksy, a grocery store clerk, is busy at work, keeping the place tidy and organized. He works diligently, making sure that everything is in its proper place. Suddenly, he hears a loud noise coming from one of the nearby offices. It sounds like something has fallen and shattered. Aleksy goes to investigate and finds that a vase has been knocked over and broken. He looks around to see if anyone is nearby who could have seen what happened, but there is no one in sight. Aleksy carefully cleans up the mess and goes back to his work.
