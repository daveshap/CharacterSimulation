Sandy walked under the Eiffel Tower, admiring its grandeur in the moonlight. She had always wanted to visit Paris, and now that she was here, she was determined to make the most of it. She had only been in the city for a few days, but she had already fallen in love with it. as she walked, she felt a sense of unease. She told herself it was just because she was in a foreign city, but she couldn't shake the feeling. She quickened her pace, but before she could reach her hotel, she was grabbed from behind. She struggled to free herself, but the man was too strong. He covered her mouth with his hand to keep her from screaming, and dragged her into an alleyway. Sandy's heart was pounding in her chest as she realized she was going to be raped. The man pushed her to the ground and pulled her dress up. Sandy fought back, but it was futile. The man was too strong and too drunk. She felt his hands on her body, exploring her, and then she felt the pain as he forced himself inside her. She cried out, but it only made him more excited. He kept forcing himself deeper and deeper until Sandy thought she would die from the pain. She begged and pleaded for him to stop, but he only laughed and kept going. Eventually, he finish and rolled off of her. Sandy lay there, crying and shaking, her dress still around her waist. She felt dirty and violated, and she knew she would never be the same again.
