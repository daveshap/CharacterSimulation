Wang is driving his delivery truck across the surface of the moon. It is a dark and cold night, and the only light comes from the truck's headlights. Wang is tired and wants to go home, but he still has one more delivery to make. Suddenly, Wang sees something in the road ahead of him. He slows down, and as he gets closer, he sees that it is a person. The person is lying in the road, and they don't appear to be moving. Wang gets out of his truck to see if the person is okay. He can see that they are wearing a spacesuit, but their helmet is off. Wang can see that the person is not breathing. Wang knows that he should call for help, but he also knows that it will take hours for help to arrive. He decides to try to revive the person himself. Wang starts CPR, and after a few minutes, the person begins to breathe again. Wang is relieved, and he helps the person into his truck so that he can take them to the hospital.
