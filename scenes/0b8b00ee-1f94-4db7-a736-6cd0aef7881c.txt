The Eiffel Tower looms overhead, its steel frame towering into the sky. The morning sun casts a long shadow across the ground, and the few people around are hurrying to their destinations. Bob is moving slowly, taking in the sights and sounds of the city as he goes. He's been running his coffee shop for years, and he knows every corner of this city like the back of his hand. He's on his way to the market to stock up on supplies for the day, but he can't help but stop and admire the view. After a moment, he shakes himself out of his reverie and continues on his way.
