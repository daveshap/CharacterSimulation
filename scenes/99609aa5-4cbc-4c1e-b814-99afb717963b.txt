Bob is standing on a mountaintop in Europe, surrounded by snow-capped peaks. It's lunch time, and he's enjoying the view from his coffee shop. He can see for miles in every direction, and the air is crisp and clean. He's surrounded by the sound of birds chirping and the wind blowing through the trees. He takes a deep breath and feels alive.
