It's a beautiful day, and she's enjoying the peace and quiet.Suddenly, she hears a loud cry from one of the kids. She looks over and sees that one of the toddlers has fallen and is now crying. Gabbi rushes over to comfort the child and help him up. She then takes him back to his parents, who are sitting nearby.
