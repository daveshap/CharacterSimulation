Jenna is sitting on the beach, watching the sun rise. The sky is awash in a beautiful orange glow, and the waves are crashing against the shore. She's wrapped in a light blanket, and she feels peaceful and happy. She's been thinking a lot lately about what she wants to do with her life, and she's decided that she wants to travel the world. She's not sure how she'll make it happen, but she's determined to find a way. Sitting here on the beach, watching the sun rise, she feels like anything is possible.
