It's early morning, and the sun is just starting to peek over the horizon. The birds are chirping and the breeze is blowing gently through the trees. Wang, a delivery driver, pulls up to a peaceful country cottage. He climbs out of his truck and stretches his arms and legs. He takes a deep breath of the fresh air and smiles. He walks up to the door of the cottage and knocks. A moment later, the door opens and a young woman greets him. She smiles and thanks him for coming. Wang hands her a package and she signs for it. They exchange a few pleasantries and then he bid her goodbye. Wang climbs back into his truck and drives away. He feels good knowing that he's helped brighten someone's day.
