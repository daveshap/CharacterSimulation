Mashawn is busy at work, hammering away at some nails that have come loose on the Eiffel Tower. He's been working on this project for weeks now, and he's getting tired. But he knows that he has to keep going until the job is done. Suddenly, he hears a loud noise from above. He looks up just in time to see the beam he's been working on starting to collapse. He tries to run out of the way, but he's not fast enough. The beam hits him on the head, and he falls to the ground, unconscious.
