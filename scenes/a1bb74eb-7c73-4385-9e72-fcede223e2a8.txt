Sandy is sitting at her desk, working on some reports. The office is quiet and the sun is setting outside. Sandy's phone buzzes and she sees a text from her husband. He's asking if she's almost done with work. Sandy replies that she'll be home soon. She finishing up her work and gathers her things. As she's leaving, she sees the janitor working in the hallway. She says goodnight to him and heads to the elevator. The ride down is uneventful and she steps out into the lobby. The security guard nods at her as she walks to the front doors. She pushes them open and steps outside. The air is cool and the sky is dark. Sandy hurries to her car, which is parked in the lot. She gets in and drives home, thinking about what she'll make for dinner.
