Wang is delivering a package to the lunar outpost. He's driving his lunar rover across the barren landscape, kicking up dust behind him. He arrives at the outpost and is met by the airlock operator. He hands over the package and is directed to wait in the airlock chamber. Wang sits down and waits as the chamber is depressurized. Once the pressure is equalized, the door opens and he's let into the outpost. He's given a tour of the facility and shown to his quarters. He settles in and prepares for his next delivery.
