Mashawn is in his bedroom, which is in a state of disarray. Clothes are strewn about the floor, and the bed is unmade. He is sitting on the edge of the bed, his head in his hands. He looks tired and defeated. He has just returned home from work, and he is not looking forward to going back tomorrow. He hates his job, and he feels like he's stuck in a rut. He's been working construction for years, and he's never been able to move up or get ahead. It's a dead-end job, and he's tired of it. He's also tired of living in this shabby apartment. He's been there for years, and it's never felt like home. It's just a place to crash after a long day of work. He's never been able to save enough money to move to a nicer place. Mashawn is considering quitting his job and moving out of his apartment. He's not sure what he would do next, but he feels like it's time for a change. He's tired of his current situation, and he's ready for something new.
