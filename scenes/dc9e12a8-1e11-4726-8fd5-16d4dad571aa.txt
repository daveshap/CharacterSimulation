The sun was beating down on Jenna as she walked along the beach. She was carrying a towel and a bag with her lunch in it. She found a spot to sit down and spread her towel out. She opened her bag and took out her sandwich and a can of soda. She popped the can open and took a sip. She leaned back against the towel and enjoyed the sound of the waves crashing against the shore.
