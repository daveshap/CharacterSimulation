It's evening time in the city and the coffee shop is starting to get busy. Bob, the owner, is behind the counter taking orders and making coffee. He's wearing a black apron over his clothes and a blue baseball cap. His black hair is starting to get graying at the temples. The coffee shop is brightly lit with fluorescent lights. There are two large windows in the front of the shop and the door is made of glass. The walls are painted white and there are several black and white photographs of coffee beans hanging on them. There are also some shelves with different kinds of coffee beans and different flavors of coffee. Bob is taking orders from the customers and making their coffee. He's been doing this for years and he knows most of the customers by name. He chats with them as he makes their coffee and asks them about their day. Most of the customers are in their 20s or 30s. There are a few teenagers, but they're mostly there to study or do homework. They're all dressed in casual clothes and they all have laptops or books with them. The coffee shop is starting to get crowded now and there's a line of people waiting to order. Bob is moving quickly, but he's still taking the time to talk to his customers. He knows that they're all here for the coffee, but he also knows that they like the friendly atmosphere of the shop. It's been a busy night, but Bob is used to it. He's been running this coffee shop for years and he knows all of his regulars. He's made a lot of friends over the years and he knows that this is the best job he's ever had.
