Mashawn is hard at work on the lunar surface, putting the finishing touches on a new construction project. The sun is setting, and the air is growing colder. Mashawn is starting to feel tired, but he knows he has to finish the job before he can call it a day. Suddenly, he hears a noise in the distance. It sounds like someone is crying. Mashawn is curious, so he follows the sound. He comes to a small crater, and in the bottom of it, he sees a little girl. She's crying and shivering, and she's all alone. Mashawn knows he can't leave her there, so he climbs down into the crater and scoopes her up in his arms. He carries her back to the construction site, where he builds her a little bed out of some spare materials. He wraps her in a blanket and tucks her in. The little girl is asleep in no time. Mashawn watches over her all night, making sure she's safe and warm. In the morning, he takes her back to her home. This act of kindness is just another day on the job for Mashawn.
