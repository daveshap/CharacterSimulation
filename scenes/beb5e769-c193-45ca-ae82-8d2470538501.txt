The sun is setting on the mountaintop, and the sky is ablaze with oranges and pinks. The temperature is cool and the air is fresh. Tom is standing behind the bar, preparing drinks for the evening rush. He is wearing a white shirt and black pants. His hair is neatly combed and his beard is trimmed. He looks like he is in his early 30s. The bar is made of dark wood, and the shelves are lined with bottles of liquor. There is a chalkboard on the wall, with the day's specials listed. The bar stools are upholstered in red leather. The door to the bar opens and a group of people come in, laughing and talking. They take a seat at the bar and Tom greets them warmly. He asks them what they would like to drink and starts preparing their orders. The bar is soon full of people, and the atmosphere is convivial. Tom is kept busy mixing drinks and serving them to the customers. He chats with the people at the bar, getting to know them and making them feel welcome. As the evening wears on, the bar starts to clears out. Tom finishes up his shift and cleans the bar, making sure everything is in its place. He bids farewell to the remaining customers and locks the door behind him. Tom has had a busy evening, but he's happy. He loves his job and the people he meets. He feels lucky to be working in such a beautiful setting. As he walks down the mountain, he looks forward to coming back tomorrow night and doing it all over again.
