The sun is setting behind the mountains, and the sky is starting to turn a deep blue. Gabbi is up on the mountaintop, watching over the children she is babysitting. They are playing near the edge of the cliff, and she is keeping a close eye on them. Suddenly, she sees one of the children, a little girl, start to slip. Gabbi runs over and grabs her just in time, preventing her from falling over the edge. The girl is crying and shaking, and Gabbi holds her close, trying to comfort her. After a few minutes, the girl calms down and Gabbi sets her down. She gives her a hug and tells her to be more careful. The girl nods and goes back to play with her brothers and sisters. Gabbi watches them for a few more minutes, making sure they stay safe. She knows it would be a long way down if any of them fell. Finally, she takes them back to the cabin and tucks them into bed. It was a close call, but Gabbi is glad she was able to save the little girl. She knows she did her job well tonight.
