Jenna is a high schooler who has come to visit the Eiffel Tower with her family. They have been walking around the city all day and are now taking a break under the famous structure. Jenna is sitting on the ground, leaning against the base of the tower. She is looking up at the sky and admiring the view. Her parents are sitting on a bench nearby, chatting with each other. Jenna's younger brother is running around, playing with a toy car.
