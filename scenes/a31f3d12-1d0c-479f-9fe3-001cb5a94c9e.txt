It's early morning and Sandy is just waking up. She rubs her eyes and stretches her arms as she sits up in bed. She looks around the bedroom, taking in the familiar surroundings. The sun is just starting to peek through the blinds, casting a warm glow around the room. Sandy's husband is still asleep beside her, snoring gently. Sandy silently slips out of bed, careful not to wake her husband. She heads to the bathroom to start her morning routine. She washes her face, brushes her teeth, and puts on her robe. Then she goes to the kitchen to start breakfast. She puts a pan on the stove and cracks some eggs into it. While the eggs are cooking, she sets the table and puts a pot of coffee on. When everything is ready, she wakes her husband and they sit down to eat breakfast together. After breakfast, Sandy cleans up the kitchen while her husband heads to the shower. Once he's gone, she takes the opportunity to check her email and catch up on the news. After a few minutes, her husband comes out of the shower and gets dressed for the day. He gives Sandy a kiss goodbye and heads out the door. Sandy is now alone in the house. She takes a moment to just relax and enjoy the quiet. Then she gets up and starts getting ready for her day.
