Wang is driving his delivery truck through a dense, dark forest in South America. He's been on the road for hours, and he's starting to get hungry. He looks at his watch and realizes it's lunch time. He pulled over to the side of the road and climbs into the back of his truck to grab his lunch. He opens his cooler and pulls out a sandwich and a can of soda. He climbs back into the front of the truck and starts to eat his lunch. Suddenly, he hears a noise in the distance. It sounds like something is moving through the trees. He turns off the engine and listens carefully. The noise is getting closer. Wang reaches for his gun and gets out of the truck. He quietly closes the door and starts to walk towards the noise. He's getting closer and he can see movement in the trees. Suddenly, a huge tiger jumps out at him! Wang squeezes off a couple of shots, but they don't seem to faze the tiger. The tiger knocks him to the ground and starts to maul him. Wang is fighting for his life. He knows he won't be able to hold the tiger off forever. He reaches for his knife and starts to stab the tiger in the side. The tiger roars in pain and finally backs off. Wang is covered in blood, but he's alive. He climbs back into his truck and drives away. He's going to have to find a different route to make his delivery.
