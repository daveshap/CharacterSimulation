Mashawn lazily wakes up from his bed, checking the time on his phone. He realizes he's slept in a bit too late and needs to hurry if he wants to make it to lunch on time. He quickly grabs his work clothes and throws them on, not bothering to check if they're wrinkled or not. He grabs his lunch pail and rushes out the door, making sure to lock it behind him. He jogs down the stairs of his apartment complex and makes his way towards the construction site. He can see his co-workers already hard at work and knows he's going to be in for a scolding from the boss. He picks up the pace, but is still a few minutes late. When he finally reaches the construction site, his boss is already there, waiting for him. Mashawn hangs his head in shame as he is scolded and told to get to work. He hurries over to his station and starts working, trying to make up for lost time.
