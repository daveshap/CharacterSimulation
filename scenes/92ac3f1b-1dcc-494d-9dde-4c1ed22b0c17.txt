He's just about to take his break when he sees a customer coming towards him. The customer, a young woman, looks around the store for a moment before coming up toAleksy. She seems a bit nervous, and Aleksy can see that she's holding a small, delicate object in her hand. The woman asks Aleksy for help in finding something, and Aleksy does his best to assist her. However, he can tell that she's still quite nervous, and he wonders what she's holding in her hand. Finally, the woman finds what she's looking for, and she thanks Aleksy before quickly leaving the store. Aleksy watches her go, curious about the object she was holding.
