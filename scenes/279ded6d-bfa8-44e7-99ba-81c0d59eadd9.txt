Wang is driving his truck through a dark forest in South America. He is getting close to his destination, but he is having a hard time seeing the road ahead of him. It is getting dark, and the headlights of his truck are not doing a good job of lighting up the way. Suddenly, Wang sees a figure in the road ahead of him. He slams on the brakes, but it is too late. He hits the figure, and it falls to the ground. Wang jumps out of his truck to see what he has hit. It is a young woman. She is lying on the ground, not moving. Wang can see that she is badly injured. He knows that he needs to get help for her, but he is not sure what to do. He decides to try to call for help on his cell phone. But when he tries to make a call, he gets no signal. He is in a remote area of the forest, and there is no way to get help. Wang knows that the woman is going to die if he does not do something. He makes a decision. He picks her up and puts her in the back of his truck. He will take her to the nearest town and get help for her. Wang drives as fast as he can through the dark forest. He finally arrives in the town. He takes the woman to the local hospital and gets her the help she needs. The woman survives, and Wang is hailed as a hero.
