He stirring the pot on the stove and taking a quick peek in the oven. Satisfied that everything is on track, he goes to set the table. Bob pulls out plates and silverware from the cupboard and arrange them on the table. He then goes to the fridge and pulls out a pitcher of iced tea and a platter of sandwiches. He sets these in the middle of the table and takes a seat. A few minutes later, his wife Sarah enters the cottage. She gives him a quick kiss on the cheek and takes a seat at the table. The two of them chat as they enjoy their lunch.
