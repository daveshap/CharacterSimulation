The air is frigid and Tom's breath mists in front of his face. He's been bartending for hours and is eager for his shift to end. He can see his breath in the cold night air and he can see the lights of the village below. He's high up on the mountain, and the only sound is the howling of the wind. Tom's relief arrives and he starts to descend the mountain. The path is narrow and treacherous, and Tom is careful to take each step with care. He knows that one false step could mean a deadly fall. As he nears the bottom, he can see the lights of the village getting brighter and he can hear the sound of people talking and laughing. He's finally made it back to safety.
