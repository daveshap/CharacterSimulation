Mashawn is standing on the mountaintop, gazing out at the sunset. The sky is a beautiful orange, and the mountains in the distance are a deep blue. The air is cool and fresh, and Mashawn can hear the sound of birds chirping in the distance. He feels a sense of peace and calm. Suddenly, Mashawn hears a loud noise behind him. He turns around and sees a group of construction workers, who are busy at work building a new structure. They are Noise, and the sound of their work echoes through the mountains. Mashawn watches the workers for a few minutes, before turning back to the sunset. He is filled with a sense of wonder and happiness, and he knows that this is a moment he will always remember.
