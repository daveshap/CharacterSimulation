Mashawn is working on a construction site in the city. It's a hot day and he's sweating from the heat and the physical labor. He takes a break to wipe the sweat from his brow and take a drink of water. He looks up at the skyline and marvels at the tall buildings. He's never been to the city before and he's impressed by the sights.
