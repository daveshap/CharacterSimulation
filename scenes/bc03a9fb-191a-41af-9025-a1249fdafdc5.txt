Bob is standing on the mountaintop, admiring the view. The sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, painting the sky in a beautiful array of colors. Bob can see the valley below, where his coffee shop is located. He can see the people beginning to stir, getting ready for their day. Bob takes a deep breath of the fresh mountain air and feels his muscles relax. It's been a long week and he's looking forward to a day of rest. He's been working hard to get his coffee shop up and running, and it's finally starting to pay off. Bob heads back down the mountain, looking forward to a cup of his own coffee and a quiet day at the shop.
