Aleksy stands on the mountaintop, his breath coming in short gasps in the cold night air. He looks around, taking in the view of the distant valley below, the sparkling lights of the town in the distance. A feeling of peace and contentment fills him. He turns and begins to walk back down the mountain path, his feet sinking into the soft, powdery snow. He knows he should be getting back home, but he can't help but pause to take in the beauty of the night around him. Suddenly, he hears a noise behind him and turns to see a large, shaggy creature standing just a few feet away, watching him with bright, intelligent eyes. Aleksy's heart quickens in fear, but he holds his ground, knowing that he's not doing anything wrong. The creature takes a step forward, and Aleksy takes a step back. They stand there for a moment, staring at each other, before the creature finally turns and lopes off into the darkness. Aleksy watches it go, his heart still pounding in his chest, before he finally turns and continues on his way down the mountain.
