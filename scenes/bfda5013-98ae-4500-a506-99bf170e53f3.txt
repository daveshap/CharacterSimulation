Mashawn is working the graveyard shift at a construction site in the city. He's been working for hours, and is starting to get tired. The bright city lights are starting to give him a headache. He takes a break and sits down on a bench. He takes out his phone and starts to scroll through social media. He sees a post about a party that's happening tonight. He remembers that he was invited. He decides to go to the party. Mashawn finishes his break and goes back to work. He works for another hour before he's finally done for the night. He cleans up his work area and goes to clock out. He's looking forward to going to the party and letting loose. He walks to the party location, which is a warehouse in a shady part of town. He can hear the music from outside. He walks in and sees people dancing and drinking. He sees his friends and goes over to them. They hand him a drink and they all start dancing. Mashawn has been dancing and drinking for a while now and he's starting to feel buzzed. He's having a great time. He's laughing and joking with his friends. He sees a girl across the room and starts to feel attracted to her. He starts to make his way over to her. As he's walking, he trips over a coil of rope and falls. He hits his head on a table and is knocked unconscious. His friends come over and help him up. They take him to the hospital.
