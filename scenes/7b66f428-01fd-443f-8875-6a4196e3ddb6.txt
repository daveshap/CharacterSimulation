The sun is shining brightly as Swathi enters her cottage in the country. She takes a deep breath of the fresh air and feels a sense of calm wash over her. The rustling of leaves in the gentle breeze is the only sound she can hear. Inside, the cottage is cozy and warm. A fire is crackling in the fireplace and a pot of tea is steeping on the stove. Swathi takes off her shoes and settles down on the couch with a contented sigh. She picks up her laptop and begins to work, but after a few minutes she finds herself daydreaming about the weekend. She's looking forward to taking a long walk in the woods and breathing in the crisp autumn air. Maybe she'll even find a few mushrooms to add to her tea!
