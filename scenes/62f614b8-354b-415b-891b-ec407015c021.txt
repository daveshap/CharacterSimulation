The sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon as Gabbi hefts her heavy backpack onto her shoulders. She's been up for hours already, getting the kids ready for their day out. Now it's time for her to head to her own destination - the Eiffel Tower. Gabbi has always loved coming to this spot. It's so peaceful in the early morning, with only a few other people around. She likes to sit on the grass and watch the sun rise over the city. Today, however, there's something different in the air. Gabbi can't quite put her finger on it, but she feels a sense of excitement and anticipation. She quickens her pace as she approaches the tower. Suddenly, she sees it. A flash of gold at the top of the Eiffel Tower. Gabbi can't believe her eyes - it's a real live unicorn! She watches, enchanted, as the magical creature prances around the tower. This is definitely the most magical moment of her life. Gabbi knows she'll never forget it.
