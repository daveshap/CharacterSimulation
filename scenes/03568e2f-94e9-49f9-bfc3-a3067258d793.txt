Wang is a delivery driver who is making a delivery to a mountaintop in Europe. He drives up to the mountaintop and sees that there is a beautiful view of the countryside. He gets out of his truck and starts to unload the boxes of goods that he is delivering. Suddenly, he hears a noise behind him. He turns around and sees a large, ferocious looking dog. The dog is growling and coming towards him. Wang drops the boxes and runs back to his truck. He gets in and drives away as fast as he can.
