Mashawn is enjoying his afternoon off from work by attending a concert in the park. He's surrounded by people of all ages, dancing and singing along to the music. The sun is shining and the atmosphere is festive. Mashawn is tapping his foot along to the beat, clapping his hands when the chorus comes in. He's not really paying attention to the lyrics, but he knows the melody and it's catchy. He looks around at the people around him and sees that they're all smiling and having a good time. The concert goes on for a few more hours and Mashawn is having a great time. He's starting to feel a bit tired, but he doesn't want to leave just yet. He's not sure if he's going to stay for the whole thing, but he's enjoying himself for now.
