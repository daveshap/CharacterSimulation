The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow over the quiet beach. Aleksy is sitting on the sand, letting the waves crash over his feet. He's been up for a few hours already, but he likes to come to the beach to watch the sunrise and clear his head before starting his day. Aleksy works at a small grocery store a few miles from the beach. It's not his dream job, but it pays the bills and he enjoys the people he works with. He's been working there for a little over a year, ever since he moved to Asia to be closer to his family. This is Aleksy's favorite time of day. He likes to sit and watch the world wake up around him. He's never been a morning person, but something about the peace and quiet of the beach helps him start his day off on the right foot.
