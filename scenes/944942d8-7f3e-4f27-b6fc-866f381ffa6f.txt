Gabbi is in the middle of a concert, surrounded by people dancing and singing along to the music. The air is thick with the smell of sweat and beer. Gabbi is babysitting a group of children, who are all running around and having a great time. She is keeping a close eye on them, making sure they don't get lost in the crowd. As the concert goes on, the children start to get tired and Gabbi starts to worry about them. She tries to keep them entertained by dancing with them and singing along to the music, but eventually they all fall asleep. Gabbi is relieved and happy that she was able to keep them safe and sound during the concert.
