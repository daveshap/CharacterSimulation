It's a dark, gloomy day in the forest, and Swathi is taking her lunch break. She's sitting on a log, eating her sandwich and looking around at the dark trees. There's a feeling of malice in the air, and Swathi can't shake the feeling that something is watching her. Suddenly, she hears a branch snap. She turns around, but there's nothing there. She tells herself it's just her imagination, but she can't help but feel uneasy.
