It's a dark and stormy night, and Aleksy is all alone in the grocery store. He's just finished his shift and is about to head home when he hears a strange noise coming from the back of the store. He cautiously approaches, trying to stay quiet, and peeks around the corner to see what's making the noise. To his horror, he sees a group of large, furry creatures rummaging through the store's food supply. They're giant rats! Aleksy is paralyzed with fear as he watches the rats devour everything in sight. He knows he should run, but he can't move. Suddenly, one of the rats notices him and starts to advance toward him, baring its sharp teeth. Aleksy knows he's about to become their next meal.
