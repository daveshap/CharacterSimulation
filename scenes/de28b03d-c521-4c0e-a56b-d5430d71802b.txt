Sandy is walking down the street, returning home from her afternoon walk. The sun is setting and the city is starting to light up. Sandy feels a sense of peace and happiness as she walks through the quiet streets. She waves to a neighbor as she passes by, and she can hear the sound of laughter coming from a nearby park. As Sandy approaches her home, she notices that the lights are on and she can see her husband and children through the windows. She feels a surge of love and happiness as she walks up to the house and goes inside.
