The Eiffel Tower loomed overhead, its metal frame stark against the night sky. Gabbi huddled beneath it, her arms wrapped around herself for warmth. She was supposed to be babysitting the kids in the nearby apartment complex, but they had run off hours ago. Now, she was just trying to stay out of sight and stay warm until morning. She heard footsteps approaching and tensed up, but relaxed when she saw it was just a homeless man rummaging through a trash can. He didn't even look up at her as he shuffled off into the darkness. Gabbi shivered and tried to curl up into a tighter ball. She wasn't sure how much longer she could last out here. Maybe she should just go back to the apartment and face the music. But she was so cold, and she wasn't sure she could make it back up the stairs. She was just starting to drift off to sleep when she heard voices. She jolted awake and peered out from her hiding spot. A group of men were walking towards her, laughing and joking. They were obviously drunk. Gabbi's heart raced as she tried to think of what to do. Should she try to run? But where would she go? They would easily catch her. She was about to start screaming for help when one of the men spotted her. "Well, well, well. What do we have here?" he called out, leering at her. Gabbi shrank back as the men approached. She was trapped.
