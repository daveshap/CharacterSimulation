It's a pitch black, moonless night. Sandy is sound asleep in her bed, when she suddenly wakes up. She has no idea what woke her up, but she knows she needs to check on her kids. She quietly gets out of bed, careful not to wake her husband, and tiptoes to her children's bedroom. Peeking inside, she sees that all is well, and her kids are fast asleep. She breathes a sigh of relief and goes back to bed. But just as she's about to drift off to sleep, she hears a noise coming from downstairs. Cautiously, Sandy gets out of bed again and creeps downstairs. She very slowly opens the door to the living room, and is shocked to see a burglar rummaging through her things! In a split second, Sandy knows she needs to act. She quietly grabs a vase and sneaks up on the burglar, whacking him over the head with it. The burglar crumples to the ground, unconscious. Sandy quickly grabs her phone and calls the police. Within minutes, they arrive and arrest the burglar. Sandy is shaken, but relieved that her family is safe.
