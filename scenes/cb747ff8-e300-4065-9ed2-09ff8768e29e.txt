Gabbi is sitting on the ground, leaning against the Eifel Tower. She is surrounded by a group of children who are playing and laughing. Gabbi is smiling and watching the children, but she looks a bit tired. The sun is beginning to set and the sky is turning a beautiful orange color. The air is cooling down and Gabbi pulls her jacket closer around her. She continues to watch the children as they play and have fun. After a while, the children start to get tired and they come to sit with Gabbi. They all lean against the Eifel Tower and look up at the sky. The stars are beginning to come out and the children point and make wishes. Gabbi looks at the children and feels happy that she gets to spend her time with them.
