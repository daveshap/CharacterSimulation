The sun is shining brightly as Tom steps out of his car and approaches the quaint country cottage. He can hear the sound of birds chirping in the nearby trees and the gentle sound of a stream running nearby. As he approaches the front door, he notices the flowers in the garden are in full bloom and the bees are busy collecting pollen. He takes a deep breath of the fresh, country air and smiles. Tom unlockes the door and steps inside. The cottage is warm and inviting, with a cozy fire burning in the fireplace. He can see the kitchen through an open door, and everything looks clean and tidy. He sets his bag down and hangs up his coat, then heads into the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea. He takes a seat by the fire with his tea and closes his eyes, letting the peace and quiet of the cottage wash over him. He feels himself start to relax and drift off to sleep.
