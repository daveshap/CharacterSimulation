The forest is dark and Wang is driving through it, early in the morning. He is delivering supplies to a remote village. The road is narrow and winding, and the trees hang low over it, making it feel even darker. Wang is a bit nervous, as he has heard stories about the forest being full of dangerous animals. But so far he has seen nothing but birds and small animals. As he rounds a bend in the road, he sees something moving in the shadows. He slows down, heart racing, and shines his headlights on the spot. There, in the middle of the road, is a large snake. Wang has never seen a snake this big before. It must be at least 10 feet long! He is frozen in fear, not knowing what to do. The snake starts to move toward the car. Wang panics and hits the gas. The car careens off the road and into the trees. Wang is shaken up but not hurt. He gets out of the car to assess the damage. The front of the car is smashed and the tires are flat. Wang is surrounded by the dark forest and has no idea what to do. He is scared and alone.
