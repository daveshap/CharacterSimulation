The sun had barely peeked over the horizon when Gabbi started her shift. She had to be up early to beat the morning traffic. The city was already starting to stir as she made her way to her first job of the day. The streets were lined with cars and the sidewalk was crammed with people hurrying to their destinations. Gabbi weaved through the crowd, making her way to the apartment building where she was supposed to babysit for the day. She reached the building and pressed the button for the elevator. She rode it up to the tenth floor, where the family she was babysitting for lived. She knocked on the door and was let in by the mom. The mom handed her a list of things to do for the day and kissed her son goodbye. Then she was out the door, off to work. Gabbi was left alone with the boy, who was already getting into mischief.
