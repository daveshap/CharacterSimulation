Wang is driving his delivery truck through a dark forest in South America. He is tired and wants to make his delivery so he can return to his hotel and rest. He is not familiar with the area and is having trouble seeing the road. Suddenly, he hears a noise in the forest and slows down to investigate. He sees a large animal standing in the road. He does not know what it is and is afraid it will attack him. He slams on the brakes and the truck skids to a stop. The animal is a jaguar and it is about to attack Wang.
