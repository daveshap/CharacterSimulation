Gabbi finished her last job of the day and started her walk home. It was a beautiful night on the moon. The air was crisp and the stars were shining bright. Gabbi breathed in deeply and smiled. She was almost home when she heard a noise coming from the nearby forest. Gabbi was curious, so she decided to investigate. As she got closer, she could see a group of aliens gathered around a fire. They were laughing and joking and having a great time. Gabbi was about to turn and go home when one of the aliens spotted her. They all turned to look at her and Gabbi froze. Then, one of the aliens stepped forward and held out his hand. Gabbi hesitated for a moment, but then decided to take a chance. She reached out and took the alien's hand. He pulled her into the circle and they all started to dance. Gabbi laughed and danced along with them. It was the best night of her life.
