Mashawn is in the middle of a huge concert, surrounded by throngs of people. He's sweating profusely, and his heart is pounding in his chest. The music is deafening, and the lights are so bright that they're almost blinding. He's never felt so alive before. He's jumping up and down, waving his hands in the air, and singing at the top of his lungs. He's completely lost in the moment, and he doesn't care about anything else in the world.
