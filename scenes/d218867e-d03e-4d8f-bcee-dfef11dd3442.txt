The sea is particularly rough tonight and the waves are crashing loudly against the shore. Mashawn is using a stick to draw patterns in the sand. He's not really paying attention to what he's doing, his mind is elsewhere. He's thinking about his wife and child back home and how much he misses them. He's only been away for a few weeks, but it feels like an eternity. Suddenly, he hears a noise from the direction of the trees. He stands up, alert and ready to defend himself, but relaxes when he sees that it's just a rabbit. The rabbit doesn't seem to be bothered by the noise and continues munching on some grass. Mashawn sits back down and goes back to his drawings. He's not sure what to make of the rabbit, but decides to leave it be.
