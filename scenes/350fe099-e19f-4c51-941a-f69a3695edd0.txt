Bob is in the middle of a concert, surrounded by people of all ages. He's enjoying the music, tapping his foot along to the beat. The sun is shining and the atmosphere is festive. Suddenly, his cell phone rings. He looks down at the screen and sees that it's his coffee shop. He hesitates for a moment, but then decides to answer. "Hello? Yes, this is Bob. What can I do for you?" He listens for a moment, a look of concern spreading across his face. "Oh no, that's not good. I'll be right there." He hangs up the phone and starts to make his way through the crowd, apologizing as he bumps into people. He's obviously in a hurry, and people are starting to notice. "Excuse me, excuse me. I'm sorry, I have to go." He finally makes it to the edge of the crowd and starts to run. He's obviously worried about something.
