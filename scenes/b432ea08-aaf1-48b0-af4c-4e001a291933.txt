Sandy is sitting at her desk, eating her lunch and scrolling through her Facebook feed. She sees a post from her friend Sarah, who is also a stay-at-home mom. Sarah is sharing a picture of her kids with the caption "I'm so grateful for my beautiful children!" Sandy feels a pang of jealousy, wishing she could trade places with Sarah. She closes the Facebook app and goes back to work.
