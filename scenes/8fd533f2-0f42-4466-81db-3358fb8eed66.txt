The sun is setting over the savanna, casting a warm glow over the landscape. In the distance, a herd of elephants can be seen grazing peacefully. Closer to the camera, Bob the coffee shop owner is busy preparing for the evening rush. He grinds the beans and brews the coffee, chatting with his customers as they come in and out. The air is filled with the rich smell of freshly brewed coffee and the atmosphere is calm and relaxed.
