The scene is an office building in the middle of the night. Bob, a coffee shop owner, is in his office, working on some paperwork. He's been working all night and is starting to get tired. He looks up at the clock and sees that it's almost 2 AM. He's just about to finish up when he hears a noise outside his office. He gets up to investigate and sees a man in a ski mask trying to break into the office next door. Bob grabs a baseball bat and confronts the man. The man tries to run away, but Bob catches up to him and knocks him out with the bat. He calls the police and tells them what happened. They arrest the man and take him away. Bob goes back to his office and finishes up his work.
