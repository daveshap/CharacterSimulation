Bob stands beneath the Eiffel Tower, surveying his coffee shop. It's been a busy day, and he's pleased with the steady stream of customers. He's especially glad to see so many tourists, as they always tend to spend a little extra. He's just about to head back inside when he notices a large group of people walking towards him. They're all carrying cameras and Maps, and he can tell they're lost. He smiles and waves them over. "Welcome to my shop!" he calls out. "Can I help you find something?" The tourists crowd around him, eagerly asking for directions and recommendations. Bob takes his time with each of them, making sure they know exactly where they're going. He knows that if he can help them have a great experience in Paris, they'll remember his coffee shop and come back. After a few minutes, the group starts to disperse. Bob watches them go, feeling proud of his little shop. He knows that he's made a difference in their trip, and that's what he loves about his job.
