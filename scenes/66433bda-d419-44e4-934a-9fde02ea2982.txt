GabbiFinish walks up to the Eiffel Tower just as the sun is setting. The sky is a beautiful orange, and the City of Lights is just starting to twinkle. Gabbi looks up at the tower, admiring its beauty for a moment, before she notices a small girl sitting on the ground, crying. Gabbi walks over to the girl and asks her what's wrong. The girl, who is about six years old, sniffles and wipes her eyes before she responds. She tells Gabbi that she got separated from her family while they were visiting the tower, and she doesn't know how to find them. Gabbi assures the little girl that she will help her find her family. She takes the girl's hand and starts walking around the tower, asking people if they have seen the girl's family. After a few minutes, they finally find the girl's parents, who are very relieved to be reunited with their daughter. Gabbi finishes her job for the night and heads home, feeling happy that she was able to help the little girl.
