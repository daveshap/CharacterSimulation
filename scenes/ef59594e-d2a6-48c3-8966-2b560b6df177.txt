Jenna had just finished her last day of high school and was looking forward to a relaxing summer break. She was spending the first few weeks of her vacation at her grandparents' cottage in the country. It was a peaceful place, surrounded by fields and forests. Jenna was sitting on the porch, watching the sunset. The sky was a beautiful orange, and the stars were just beginning to come out. She heard the sound of her grandfather playing the piano inside the cottage. It was a peaceful evening.
