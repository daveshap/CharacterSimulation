Wang is driving his delivery truck through the city when he gets caught in the middle of a massive concert. Thousands of people are cheering and singing along to the music, which is blasting from huge speakers all around him. Wang's truck is surrounded by people dancing and jumping up and down, and he can barely move forward. He honks his horn and tries to inch his way through the crowd, but it's impossible. He's finally forced to stop and wait it out until the concert ends.
