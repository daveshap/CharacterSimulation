Gabbi is sitting on the porch of a small hut, minding a group of small children. It is a hot day, and the children are running around and playing games to stay cool. Gabbi is fanning herself with a piece of cardboard, and occasionally spritzing the children with a water bottle to keep them from getting too sweaty. lunch time is always a busy time for Gabbi. She has to watch the children, make sure they stay out of the sun, and stop them from fighting with each other. But she doesn't mind, because she loves children. And besides, it's not like she has anything else to do. Gabbi grew up in this small village in Africa. She never went to school, and her parents could not afford to send her away to get an education. So instead, she started working as a babysitter when she was just a teenager. It's not the most glamorous job, but it's honest work, and Gabbi is good at it. The children are starting to get restless, so Gabbi stands up and starts to lead them in a game of tag. She knows that if she can tire them out now, they'll be more likely to take a nap later. And she can use the break to catch up on her own rest.
