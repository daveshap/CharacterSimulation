It's a beautiful day on the moon. The sun is shining and the temperature is perfect. Bob is sitting in his coffee shop, enjoying a cup of coffee and a sandwich. He's looking out the window at the lunar landscape, thinking about the businesses he's going to have to start on the moon. He's got a lot of work to do, but he's enjoying the peace and quiet of the moment.
