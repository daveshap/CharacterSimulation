The sun has started to dip below the horizon, casting a beautiful orange glow over the landscape. The savannah is alive with the sounds of animals and insects, and the air is thick with the smell of dust and sweat. Mashawn is walking home from a hard day's work. He's tired and dirty, and his muscles ache from lifting heavy bags of cement all day. He's looking forward to taking a cool shower and relaxing for the evening. As he nears his home, he hears a strange noise coming from the bushes. He freezes, listening carefully. It sounds like someone is crying. He slowly approaches the bushes, heart pounding in his chest. He parts the leaves and sees a young gazelle, its leg caught in a trap. The gazelle is bleeding and in pain, and its frantic cries are echoing through the silent evening. Mashawn knows he can't leave the gazelle to suffer. He quickly springs into action, using his knife to cut the gazelle's leg free from the trap. He carefully applies pressure to the wound to stop the bleeding and comforts the terrified animal until it calms down. Mashawn knows he can't just leave the gazelle here. It's too weak to walk, and the predators will be out soon. So, he scooped the gazelle into his arms and started the long walk to the nearest vet. It's going to be a long night, but Mashawn knows he's made the right decision.
