Jenna was laying on her towel on the beach, soaking up the sun and enjoying the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. She had been here for a few hours, but it felt like the day was just flying by. Jenna loved coming to this spot; it was so peaceful and calming. Suddenly, Jenna heard a loud noise and sat up to see a group of people running towards her. She was confused and scared, wondering what was happening. The group was getting closer and Jenna could see that they were all yelling and looked very panicked. Without knowing what else to do, Jenna got up and started running towards the group. As she got closer, she could hear them yelling, "There's a shark! There's a shark!" Jenna's heart sank as she realized what was happening. Everyone was running in different directions, trying to get away from the shark. Jenna was about to run towards the safety of the shore when she saw a little girl standing in the water, frozen in fear. Jenna's instinct was to save her. Without thinking any further, Jenna ran towards the girl and scooped her up in her arms. She then started sprinting towards the shore as fast as she could. Jenna's heart was pounding in her chest as she ran, but she didn't stop until she reached the safety of the sand. Once she was out of the water, Jenna put the little girl down and they both collapsed onto the sand, exhausted. Jenna was relieved that they were both safe and thankful that she was able to help.
