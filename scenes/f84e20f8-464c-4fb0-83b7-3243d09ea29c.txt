Wang is a delivery driver who is currently on his lunch break. He's sitting on a bench near his truck, enjoying a meal of rice and beans. The sun is beating down on him, but he doesn't mind. He's used to the heat. Suddenly, he hears a loud noise. He looks up and sees a herd of elephants stampeding towards him. He knows he won't be able to outrun them, so he quickly jumps into his truck and tries to start it. The engine roars to life and he hits the gas, speeding away from the dangerous animals. He breathes a sigh of relief as he puts some distance between himself and the elephants. That was a close one!
