Gabriella, or Gabbi for short, was your typical babysitter. She was in high school, and she loved kids. She was responsible, polite, and always had a smile on her face. She was currently babysitting for a family in a high-rise apartment building in the city. It was a beautiful day outside, and the family's children were playing in the park across the street. Gabbi was watching them from the window, making sure they were staying safe. Suddenly, Gabbi's phone rang. It was the mother of the children she was babysitting. She sounded panicked and said she was on her way home, but she would be a little late. Gabbi said it was no problem and that she would watch the children until she got home. The mother sounded relieved and thanked Gabbi before hanging up. Gabbi went back to watching the children, but now she was a little more on edge. She wanted to make sure the children were safe until their mother got home.
