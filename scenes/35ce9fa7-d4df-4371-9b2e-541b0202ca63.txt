Mashawn is a construction worker who is currently working on a project near a quiet beach in Asia. It's a beautiful day out and he's enjoying the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. He's been working hard all day and is ready for a break. He climbs down from his work site and heads over to the beach for a quick swim. He strips down to his swim trunks and dives into the water. The water is refreshing and he swims around for a few minutes before coming back to the shore. He lies down on the sand and enjoys the warm sun on his skin. He closes his eyes and relaxes for a few minutes before getting up and heading back to work.
