Wang is driving his delivery truck through a dark forest in South America. He is getting close to his destination, but he is starting to get worried because he can't see anything in the darkness. He is also starting to hear strange noises coming from the woods. Finally, he arrives at the address he was looking for. He gets out of the truck, but he is immediately attacked by a creature that comes out of the darkness. Wang screams as he is being pulled into the darkness.
