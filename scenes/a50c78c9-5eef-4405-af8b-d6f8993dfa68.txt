Tom is walking through a dark forest in South America. It is 6pm and the sun is beginning to set. Tom is carrying a large backpack and is wearing a bright red coat. He is sweating and panting as he walks, and his breath is visible in the cold air. He seems to be following a path through the forest, although it is difficult to see in the dim light. Tom has been walking for some time, and he is beginning to feel tired and thirsty. He stops for a rest, and takes a drink from his water bottle. As he does so, he hears a noise in the distance. It sounds like someone is crying. Tom begins to follow the sound, and he soon comes to a clearing in the forest. In the clearing is a small cabin, and in front of the cabin is a young woman. The woman is kneeling on the ground, and her face is buried in her hands. She is sobbing uncontrollably. Tom approaches the woman and asks her if she is okay. The woman does not respond, and Tom can see that she is in a state of shock. He takes off his backpack and opens it, and takes out a blanket. He wraps the woman in the blanket and helps her to her feet. He leads her into the cabin and sits her down in a chair. He then rummages through his backpack, and takes out a first aid kit. He tends to the woman's cuts and bruises, and gives her a drink of water. The woman is still in a state of shock, but she is beginning to calm down. She tells Tom her name is Sarah, and she tells him what happened. She says that she was hiking in the forest with her boyfriend when they were attacked by a group of men. Sarah's boyfriend was killed, and she was raped and beaten. The men left her for dead, but she managed to crawl to the cabin. Tom comforts Sarah, and tells her that she is safe now. He says that he will stay with her until morning, and then he will take her to the nearest town. Sarah thanks Tom, and begins to cry again.
