Sandy is sitting on a bench under the Eiffel Tower, enjoying a quiet moment to herself. She's been wanting to come here for years, and she's finally made it. The Tower is even more impressive in person than she ever could have imagined. As she sit and takes in the view, she people-watches and enjoys a quiet lunch. She's not in a hurry, and she savors every bite of her sandwich. It's a beautiful day, and she's grateful to have this chance to experience the tower and the city.
