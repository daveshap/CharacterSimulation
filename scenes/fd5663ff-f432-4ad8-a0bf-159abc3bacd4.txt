The sky is a deep orange, and the sun is just beginning to dip below the horizon. The waves are crashing gently against the shore, and the salty smell of the ocean is in the air. Gabbi is sitting on the beach, watching as the kids she is babysitting play in the sand. They are laughing and having a good time, and she is enjoying just taking a moment to relax.
