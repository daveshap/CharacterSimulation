It's getting dark and Gabbi has to get home, but she's lost. She's been walking for hours, and she's getting scared. She's tried calling her parents, but there's no service. She's tried to find her way back to the house where she was babysitting, but she's completely lost. Suddenly, she hears something in the bushes. She's terrified, and she doesn't know what to do. She stands there, frozen, as the thing in the bushes comes closer and closer. She can see it now... it's a big, dark, furry creature. It's a bear! The bear is coming towards her, and she's too scared to move. She's sure she's going to be killed, but then the bear just walks right past her. She's so relieved, she almost falls over. Gabbi knows she has to keep moving, but she's so tired and scared. She doesn't know how much longer she can go on. She's about to give up when she sees a light in the distance. She starts walking towards it, and she soon sees that it's a campfire. There are people around the campfire, and they see her coming. They call out to her, and she's so relieved. She's finally found her way out of the forest.
