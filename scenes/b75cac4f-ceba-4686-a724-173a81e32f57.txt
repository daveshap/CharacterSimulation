Tom is walking along the beach, enjoying the quiet night. He's carrying a backpack full of supplies, and he's headed to a nearby island. The island is a popular tourist destination, but it's currently deserted. Tom is planning to set up a bar on the island, and he's looking forward to having the place to himself. As he approaches the island, he sees a light coming from the beach. Someone is already on the island! Tom drops his backpack and runs towards the light. He arrives to find a young woman setting up a campfire. Tom is surprised to see someone on the island, but he's happy to have the company. He introduces himself to the woman, and they chat for a while by the fire.
