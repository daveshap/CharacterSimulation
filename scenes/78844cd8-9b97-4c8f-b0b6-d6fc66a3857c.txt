Jenna is sitting in an office chair at a desk, with her backpack on the floor next to her. She looks around the room, taking in the shelves of books and the framed posters on the walls. She swallows hard, feeling a bit nervous. A man walks into the room and Jenna stands up, facing him. He extends his hand and she shakes it, introducing herself. He tells her to have a seat and she does so, perching on the edge of the chair. He asks her why she's interested in the job and she starts to list off her qualifications. She talks about her experience with customer service and her love of working with people. The man nods along, seeming impressed. He asks her a few more questions and then tells her he'll be in touch. Jenna thanks him and stands up, shaking his hand again. She gathers her things and walks out of the room, feeling hopeful.
