The moon casts a eerie glow over the scene as Gabbi, a babysitter, watches over her sleeping charges. All is quiet save for the sound of Gabbi's restless breathing. She can't help but feel on edge in this lonely place. Every so often, Gabbi's eyes drift towards the window. Outside, the craters and rocks of the moon's surface are lit up by the Earth's distant blue glow. It's a beautiful sight, but it only serves to remind Gabbi of how far away she is from home. She's not sure how much longer she can take this. The pay is good, but the isolation is driving her crazy. She's beginning to feel like she's the only human left in the universe. At least the kids are cute. That's something, at least.
