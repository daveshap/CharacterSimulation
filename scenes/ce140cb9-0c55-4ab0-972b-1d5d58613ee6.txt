Sandy is sitting on the beach, enjoying the quiet and peacefulness of the moment. She's been wanting to get away from the hustle and bustle of her everyday life and just relax for a while. It's been a few months since she's been on a vacation and she's really enjoying this time to herself. She's got a little picnic set up next to her, with a few snacks and drinks to keep her going. She's got her book with her, but she's not really in the mood to read it. She's just enjoying the sound of the waves and the feel of the sand between her toes. Every now and then, she looks up at the people walking by, but for the most part, she's content to just sit there and enjoy the moment.
