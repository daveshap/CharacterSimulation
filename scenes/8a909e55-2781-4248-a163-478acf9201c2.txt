The sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a beautiful pink and orange glow across the sky. The waves are crashing gently against the shore, and the sand is cool and soft. Swathi is sitting on the beach, watching the sunrise and enjoying the peace and quiet. She's been coming to this beach every morning for the past week, and it's become her favorite place to relax and clear her head.
