Bob is sitting at his desk, in his office in an office building. It's mid-afternoon, and he's sipping a cup of coffee. He's thinking about the coffee shop he owns and how much he loves it. He's also thinking about how much work he has to do today. He has a lot of paperwork to fill out and he's not looking forward to it. But he knows he has to do it.
