Jenna is sitting at her desk in the office, munching on a sandwich and scrolling through her phone. She's wearing her school uniform, and her backpack is sitting next to her chair. She's surrounded by stacks of papers and folders, and the phone is the only thing that's really keeping her attention. Every so often, she glances up at the clock, and then goes back to her phone.
