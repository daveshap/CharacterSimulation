The darkness of the forest closes in around Tom as he walks, the afternoon sun filtered through the thick canopy of leaves overhead. He has been walking for hours, ever since he left the safety of the last village he had passed through. His destination is a small cabin deep in the woods that serves as a bar for loggers and hunters who come through this way. He finally arrives at the cabin, tired and sweaty from his hike. He opens the door and steps inside, relieved to be out of the heat and humidity. The bar is empty, except for a man sitting at one of the tables, nursing a drink. Tom walks up to the man and asks what he's drinking. The man replies that it's a special concoction made with herbs and spices that he won't tell Tom about. Tom shrugs and goes to the other side of the bar to pour himself a drink. As he sips his drink, Tom looks around the cabin. It's crudely furnished, with a few tables and chairs, and a makeshift bar made out of an old door. There are no windows, and the only light comes from a few candles that are burning on the tables. The door opens and two men come in, laughing and joking with each other. They sit down at the table with the man who wouldn't tell Tom what he was drinking, and start to play a card game. Tom leans against the bar and sips his drink, watching the men play cards and trying to ignore the feeling of dread that is building up inside of him.
