The sun is just peeking over the horizon as Bob opens up his coffee shop. He's got a big day ahead, as he's catering the breakfast shift for a big concert happening in the park across the street. He's been up for hours already, getting everything ready, and he knows he won't have a chance to sit down until it's all over. He can hear the music already, even though the concert won't start for another few hours. The park is already starting to fill up with people, and he knows it's going to be a long day. But he's happy to be a part of it, and he knows his coffee will help keep everyone going. He's just getting everything set up when he hears a shout from outside. He knows that voice - it's his old friend, Joe. Joe is one of the security guards for the concert, and he's come to get Bob's help. Apparently, there's been a mix-up with the catering order, and they're short a lot of coffee. Bob quickly grabs a bunch of his coffee beans and starts grinding them, getting ready to make a massive pot of coffee. He knows it's going to be a long day, but he's happy to help out his friends. And he knows that, at the end of it all, there will be a great concert to enjoy.
