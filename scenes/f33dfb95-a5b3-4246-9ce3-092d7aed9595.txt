Wang is a delivery driver who is currently making a delivery under the Eiffel Tower. It is the middle of the night, and Wang is feeling a bit nervous as he is not used to working this late at night. He is also feeling a bit uneasy because he is not familiar with this area of town. As Wang approaches the Eiffel Tower, he begins to hear a strange noise. It sounds like someone is crying. Wang begins to feel scared and wants to turn back, but he knows he has to make the delivery. As he gets closer to the tower, he sees a figure crouched under the structure. It is a woman, and she appears to be crying. Wang approaches her cautiously and asks if she is okay. The woman looks up at Wang with tears in her eyes and shakes her head. She then begins to tell Wang her story. She explains that her name is Sophie and that she is from Paris. She came to visit the Eiffel Tower with her boyfriend, but they got into a big fight and he left her here. She has been here for hours, and she is scared and doesn't know what to do. Wang feels sorry for Sophie and wants to help her. He offers to call her a cab so she can go home. Sophie is hesitant at first, but then she agrees. Wang helps her to her feet and flags down a cab. He gives the driver Sophie's address and then watches as the cab drives away.
