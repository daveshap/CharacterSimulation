Aleksy had been waiting all night for this moment. He was in the middle of the concert, surrounded by the pulsing music and the cheering crowd. He felt alive. This was what he lived for. For a moment, he forgot about his mundane life as a grocery store clerk. He was transported to a world of excitement and adventure. He danced and sang along with the music, losing himself in the moment. Suddenly, the music stopped and the lights came on. Aleksy blinked, disoriented. The spell was broken. He was back in the real world. As the crowd filed out of the venue, Aleksy felt deflated. He slowly made his way back to the grocery store, his home for the past four years. He was starting to feel like he was too old for this. Maybe it was time to move on.
