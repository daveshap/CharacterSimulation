Sandy sat on the edge of the mat, watching her children play in the sand. She loved this quiet beach; it was always so peaceful here. The sound of the waves crashing against the shore was soothing, and the warm sun felt good on her skin. Sandy's children were laughing and playing happily. They loved coming to the beach, too. Sandy smiled as she watched them play. She was grateful to have such wonderful kids. Suddenly, Sandy saw a movement out of the corner of her eye. She turned to see a large, dark bird flying towards her. The bird was getting closer and closer, and Sandy started to feel scared. The bird was almost upon her when Sandy finally managed to scramble to her feet and run away. She could hear the bird's wings flapping behind her, and she was terrified that it was going to catch her. Fortunately, Sandy made it to safety and the bird did not catch her. She was shaken by the experience, but she was thankful that she and her children were safe.
