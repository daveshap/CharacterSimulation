The sun had already set behind the dense forest canopy, casting the forest floor in an eerie darkness. A cool breeze blew through the trees, sending a chill down Tom's spine. He had been walking for hours, and was now completely lost. He had been following a small path through the forest, but it had long since disappeared. Tom's only hope now was to find a clearing, where he could get his bearings and figure out how to get back to civilization. Suddenly, Tom heard a twig snap. He spun around, trying to see through the darkness. He thought he saw a pair of glowing eyes staring at him from the bushes, but then they were gone. Tom's heart was racing. He had heard stories about the strange creatures that lived in these parts of the forest, and he didn't want to meet one. He continued walking, more carefully now, listening for any sign of the creature. Suddenly, he saw a light flickering in the distance. He quickened his pace, and soon came to a small clearing. In the center of the clearing was a fire, and sitting around the fire were several of the creatures. They were small and furry, with long tails and large ears. They didn't look dangerous, but Tom knew better than to trust appearances. He considered running away, but he was so tired and cold, and the fire looked so inviting. He decided to take his chances with the creatures. He stepped into the clearing and said, "Hello. My name is Tom. I'm lost. Can you help me?"
