Sandy is in her bedroom, getting ready for lunch. She's putting on a shirt and jeans, and she looks in the mirror to make sure she looks presentable. She then heads downstairs to the kitchen, where her husband and children are already sitting at the table. Everyone greets each other and they all start eating. Sandy's husband asks her how her day is going, and she responds that it's going well. They all chat while they eat, and then Sandy's husband asks if she wants to go for a walk after lunch. Sandy agrees, and they all finish up and head out. Sandy and her husband walk down the street, chatting and enjoying the nice day. They talk about their plans for the weekend, and Sandy's husband mentions that he might go fishing with his buddies. Sandy says that sounds like fun, and they continue walking. After a while, they come to a park and decide to sit down for a break. They people watch for a while, and then Sandy's husband asks her if she wants to head home. Sandy says yes, and they get up and head back home. When they get home, Sandy's husband says he's going to take a nap. Sandy says that's a good idea, and she heads upstairs to her bedroom. She lies down on her bed and closes her eyes, taking a moment to relax.
