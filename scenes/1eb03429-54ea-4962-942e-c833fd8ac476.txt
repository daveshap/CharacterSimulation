Aleksy enters his bedroom and flops down onto the mattress. He lets out a long sigh, then turns his head to the alarm clock on the nightstand. It reads 6:00pm. With a groan, he pushes himself up and begins to undress. He strips off his work clothes and tosses them into the laundry hamper, then pulls on a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt. He flops back down onto the bed, now fully dressed, and stares up at the ceiling. Aleksy's mind begins to wander as he stares at the ceiling. He thinks about his job as a grocery store clerk and how much he hates it. He thinks about how he's been working there for four years and how he's still stuck in the same dead-end position. He thinks about how he's just a 24-year-old man with no future and no prospects. His mind continues to race as he becomes more and more anxious. Suddenly, Aleksy sits up and swings his legs over the side of the bed. He can't take it anymore; he has to get out of the house. He grabs his keys and wallet and heads for the door.
