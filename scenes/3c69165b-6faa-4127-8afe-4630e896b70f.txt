The sun is high in the sky, beating down on the sand and making everything seem hazy. The waves are crashing against the shore, and a light breeze is blowing through the palms. Mashawn is sitting on the beach, eating his lunch and enjoying the view. He's been working on a construction project nearby, and he's taking a well-deserved break. He's got his feet in the water, and he's watching the people as they walk by. He's thinking about how lucky he is to be able to work in such a beautiful place.
