Swathi is standing under the Eiffel Tower, looking up at its grandeur. She's awestruck by its size and beauty. She's been to Paris many times before, but this is the first time she's been able to see the Eiffel Tower up close. She's also never been this close to the top of the tower. She can see the city skyline from here, and it's breathtaking. She can see the Seine river winding through the city, and the1 Champs-Élysées stretching off into the distance. She can even see the Arc de Triomphe. It's an incredible view. Swathi is so engrossed in the view that she doesn't hear someone walking up behind her. She's startled when she feels a hand on her shoulder. She turns to see a handsome man, who introduces himself as Pierre. He starts chatting with her in French, and she's surprised to find that she can understand him. They chat for a while, and Swathi starts to feel a connection with Pierre. They exchange phone numbers and say goodbye. As Swathi walks away, she feels happy and lucky to have had such a special experience.
