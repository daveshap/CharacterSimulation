The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the countryside. Birds are singing in the trees, and a light breeze stirs the leaves. All is quiet and peaceful. Inside the cottage, Swathi is just waking up. She stretches and yawns, then gets out of bed and goes to the window. She looks out at the beautiful morning, then goes to the kitchen to start her day.
