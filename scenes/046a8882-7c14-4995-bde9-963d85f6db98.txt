It's a cold, dark night on a mountaintop in Europe. Gabbi, a babysitter, is huddled up in a blanket, trying to stay warm. She's been up there for hours, waiting for the baby she's supposed to be watching to finally go to bed. But the baby just won't go to sleep. Gabbi is starting to get frustrated. She's tried everything - rocking the baby, singing to her, even walking her around the room - but nothing seems to work. She's about to give up and go home when she finally hears the sound of the baby's cries subsiding. Gabbi looks over and sees that the baby has finally fallen asleep. Relieved, Gabbi puts the baby down in her crib and heads home, grateful that her long night is finally over.
