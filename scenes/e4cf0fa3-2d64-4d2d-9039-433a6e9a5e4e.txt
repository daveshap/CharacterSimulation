Sandy is in her bedroom, in the middle of the night. She is awake, and she is not alone. There is a man in her bedroom with her, and he is not her husband. Sandy does not know who the man is, but she is not afraid. She knows that he is not there to hurt her. The man is standing next to the bed, and he is looking down at Sandy. Sandy is lying in bed, and she is looking up at the man. She does not say anything. She does not need to. She knows that the man is there for a reason. The man reaches down and takes Sandy's hand. He looks into her eyes, and then he speaks. "I'm here to take you away," the man says. "I'm here to take you to a place where you will be happy. A place where you will be safe. I promise." Sandy gets out of bed, and she takes the man's hand. She knows that she can trust him. She knows that he is going to take her to a better place.
