The bedroom is slightly messy, with toys strewn about the floor and clothes thrown over a chair in the corner. It's clear that a young child lives here. Gabbi, the babysitter, is sitting on the edge of the bed, reading a book to the child who is sitting next to her. Every so often, the child interrupts her to ask a question or make a comment, and Gabbi patiently answers. As the sun starts to set, Gabbi starts to wind down the story. The child protests at first, but Gabbi assures them that they can finish the book tomorrow. She tucks the child into bed, and they say their goodnights. Gabbi turns off the light and heads to the door, but not before giving the child one last reassuring pat on the back.
