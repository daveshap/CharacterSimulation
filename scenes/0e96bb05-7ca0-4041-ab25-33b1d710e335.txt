It's lunch time, and Swathi is sitting in her office cubicle, munching on a sandwich and browsing the internet. She's surrounded by the low hum of conversations and the sound of keyboard typing; her coworkers are all busy working away on their own projects. Swathi's eyes wander to the clock on her computer screen; she still has another hour left before she can take her lunch break. She takes a sip of her soda and goes back to browsing the internet.
