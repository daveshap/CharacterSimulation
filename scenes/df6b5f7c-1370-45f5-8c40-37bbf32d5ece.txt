The city is alive with energy even at this late hour. The bright lights and bustling crowds are a far cry from the quiet suburb where Gabbi lives. She feels out of place here, but she knows she has to be brave. It's her first night babysitting for the new family she's been assigned to. They live in a high-rise apartment in the heart of the city. Gabbi takes a deep breath as she steps out of the elevator onto their floor. She's met the kids before, but she's still nervous. What if they don't like her? What if she can't handle them? She takes a deep breath and knocks on the door. The mother greets her with a warm smile and Gabbi instantly feels better. The kids are already in bed, but the mother tells her they may need help to fall asleep. Gabbi nods and goes to tuck them in. She spends the next few hours reading to them and telling them stories. Eventually, they both drift off to sleep. Gabbi breathes a sigh of relief. She did it! The rest of the night is uneventful and Gabbi is able to relax and enjoy her time. She feels like she's made some new friends by the time she leaves in the morning.
