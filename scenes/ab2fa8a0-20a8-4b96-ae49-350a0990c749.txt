Aleksy is working the evening shift at the grocery store. He's been there since early this morning, and is starting to feel a bit tired. The store is starting to get busy as people do their shopping for the evening. Aleksy is keeping an eye on the customers, making sure they're finding what they need. Suddenly, the doors to the store burst open and a group of teenagers come rushing in. They're laughing and joking, and Aleksy can tell they're up to no good. He watches them warily as they start grabbing things off the shelves and stuffing them into their backpack. He knows he needs to do something, but he's not sure what. After a few moments, he decides to calling the police. He hopes they'll be able to catch the teenagers before they can get away.
