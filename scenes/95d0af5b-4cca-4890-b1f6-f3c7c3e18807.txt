The sun is just beginning to set as Wang arrives at the country cottage. He pulls to a stop in front of the house and shuts off the engine. For a moment, he just sits there, taking in the peaceful surroundings. The cottage is nestled among a group of trees, and the front porch is lined with flowerpots. There is a small path leading up to the front door. Wang gets out of the car and grabs the package from the back seat. He walks up to the door and knocks. After a moment, the door is opened by a woman in her mid-40s. She has a kind face and is wearing a flowered apron. "Hi, I have a delivery for you," Wang says, handing her the package. "Thank you," she says, taking it from him. "Have a nice evening," Wang says, turning to walk back to his car. "You too," she says, closing the door.
