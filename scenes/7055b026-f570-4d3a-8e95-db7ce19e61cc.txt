The sun is setting on the quiet beach, and Aleksy is taking a well-deserved break from his job at the grocery store. He's been working all day, and he's exhausted, but the peaceful setting and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore is helping him to relax. He's lying on his back, eyes closed, soaking up the last of the day's warmth. Suddenly, he hears a noise that startles him. He opens his eyes and sees a figure walking towards him. As the figure gets closer, Aleksy realizes that it's a woman. She's wearing a flowing white dress that looks like it's made of silk, and her long dark hair is blowing in the breeze. She's the most beautiful woman he's ever seen. The woman comes to a stop next to Aleksy, and she looks down at him with a gentle smile. "Hello," she says in a soft voice. "I'm sorry if I disturbed you." "It's okay," Aleksy replies, his heart racing. "I was just enjoying the sunset." The woman nods. "It is beautiful, isn't it? I love watching the sun set over the ocean." Aleksy nods, too lost in the woman's beauty to say anything else. After a few moments, the woman speaks again. "My name is Lily. What's your name?" "Aleksy," he replies. Lily smiles. "It's nice to meet you, Aleksy. I hope you have a nice evening." With that, she turns and walks away, leaving Aleksy alone on the beach, wondering if he's just dreaming.
