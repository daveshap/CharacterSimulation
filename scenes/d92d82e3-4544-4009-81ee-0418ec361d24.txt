The scene is set in an office building, in Bob's coffee shop. It is evening, and the shop is closing for the night. Bob is putting the chairs up on the tables and sweeping the floor. He is tired from a long day of work. As he is sweeping, he hears a noise from the back of the shop. He freezes and listens. He hears something moving around in the storage room. He knows he should call the police, but he is also curious to see what is going on. He quietly sets the broom down and grabs a baseball bat from behind the counter. He creeps to the back of the shop, bat in hand. He slowly opens the door to the storage room and peers inside. He sees a figure rummaging through the boxes. He raises the bat and prepares to swing.
