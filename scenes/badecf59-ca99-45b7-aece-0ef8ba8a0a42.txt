Mashawn climbs up the last few feet of the mountain, his heart pounding in his chest. He's finally made it to the top. As he looks around, he takes in the breathtaking view of the valley below, the setting sun bathing everything in a warm, golden light. A smile spreads across his face as he realizes that he's finally made it to his goal. He looks down at his hands, calloused and rough from years of hard work. It's all been worth it, he thinks to himself, to be able to experience this moment. He takes a deep breath and looks around one last time before starting the trek back down the mountain.
