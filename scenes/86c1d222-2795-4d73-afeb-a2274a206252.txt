Jenna is standing under the Eifel Tower, enjoying the sights and sounds of Paris. She's been here for a few days now, and has loved every minute of it. She's wearing a light summer dress and sandals, and has a small backpack with her. Jenna is people watching and enjoying the atmosphere when she notices a man walking towards her. He's well-dressed and looks like he might be a tourist. He smiles at her as he gets closer, and she smiles back. The man comes up to her and asks her in broken English if she knows where the nearest restaurant is. Jenna hesitated for a moment, unsure if she should help him or not. But then she remember her high school French teacher telling her that one of the best things about travel is being able to help others, so she directs the man to a nearby cafe. The man thanks her profusely and walk away. Jenna goes back to people watching and enjoying the sunny day.
