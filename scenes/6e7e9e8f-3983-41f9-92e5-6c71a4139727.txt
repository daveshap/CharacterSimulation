Sandy is in her kitchen, preparing lunch for her family. The table is already set, and the sun is shining in through the window. Sandy is humming to herself as she works, and the cat is curled up in a sunny spot on the floor. Everything is peaceful and quiet. Suddenly, the sound of a car engine breaking the silence. Sandy looks out the window and sees a car pulling up to the cottage. She doesn't recognize the car, or the person who gets out of it. Sandy starts to feel uneasy. The stranger walks up to the door and knocks. Sandy hesitates for a moment, then decides to answer it. As she opens the door, the stranger asks if she is Sandy. Sandy says yes, and the stranger introduces himself as a detective. The detective says that he is investigating a crime that took place in the area, and he would like to ask Sandy a few questions. Sandy agrees to answer his questions, and they step inside. The detective asks Sandy if she saw or heard anything suspicious in the past few days. Sandy tells him that she hasn't seen or heard anything out of the ordinary. After a few more questions, the detective thanks Sandy for her time and says that he will be in touch if he has any more questions. Sandy watches out the window as the detective drives away, wondering what could have happened in her peaceful country cottage.
