The sun is setting over the mountaintop, and the last of the skiers are heading down the slopes. In the distance, the lights of the town are beginning to twinkle. Tom is busy behind the bar, preparing for the evening rush. He's got bottles of beer chilling in the fridge and glasses lined up on the shelves. The jukebox is playing softly in the background. As the first customers begin to trickle in, Tom gets busy serving them. He chats with them about their day on the slopes, and recommends some of his favorite beers. The bar starts to fill up, and Tom is kept busy serving drinks and mingling with the guests. As the night goes on, the atmosphere in the bar gets more and more festive. Tom keeps the drinks flowing, and the guests are having a great time. Towards closing time, things start to wind down and people begin to head home. Tom tidies up the bar, and then closes up for the night.
