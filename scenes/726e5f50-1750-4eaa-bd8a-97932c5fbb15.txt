Mashawn climbs to the top of the mountain, his construction tools slung over his shoulder. He's been working on the new resort for weeks, and he's finally reached the summit. The sun is just starting to set, and the view is breathtaking. Mashawn can see for miles in every direction, and the air is crisp and clean. He can't help but feel a sense of accomplishment as he looks at the progress he and his team have made. Suddenly, Mashawn hears a noise behind him. He turns to see a large, furry creature standing on the edge of the cliff, watching him. Mashawn's heart races as he realizes he's face-to-face with a bear. For a moment, the two of them just stare at each other. Then, the bear lets out a loud roar and charges towards Mashawn. Mashawn doesn't have time to think. He instinctively drops his tools and runs for his life. The bear is right on his heels, but Mashawn manages to make it to safety just in time. He looks back at the bear, still standing on the edge of the cliff, and can't believe he just survived. That was a close call, he thinks to himself, as he starts the long climb back down the mountain.
