Wang steps out of his airlock onto the dusty, gray surface of the moon. He takes a deep breath of the sterile air and adjusts his suit. He starts walking across the lunar landscape, his destination the nearby moon base. As he walks, he takes in the desolate beauty of his surroundings. The sun casts a cold light on the jagged mountains and craters. Wang feels a sense of peace and wonder as he marches onward. He soon arrives at the base and is greeted by the other inhabitants. They invite him in for lunch and Wang eagerly accepts. He takes off his helmet and enjoys a meal with his new friends, feeling grateful for the moment of companionship in this lonely place.
