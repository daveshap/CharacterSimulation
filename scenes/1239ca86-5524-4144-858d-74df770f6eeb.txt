The sun is beginning to set in the sky, painting the African landscape in a beautiful array of oranges, pinks and yellows. Gabbi is sitting on the veranda of the house she is babysitting in, watching the children play in the garden. She smiles as she watches them chasing each other around, their laughter filling the air. As the sky grows darker, Gabbi starts to sing a lullaby to the children. They quickly settle down and come to sit with her, their eyes heavy with sleep. She continues to sing as they drift off to sleep, their heads resting on her lap. Once they are both asleep, Gabbi gently lays them down in their beds and tucks them in. She gives them both a kiss goodnight and quietly leaves the room, closing the door behind her.
