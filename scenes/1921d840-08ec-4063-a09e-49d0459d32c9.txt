The sun is setting over the African plains, casting a beautiful orange hue over the landscape. Jenna is walking home from school, taking in the sights and sounds of the savannah around her. She sees some elephants in the distance and hears the calls of lions and other animals she can't identify. As she walks, she thinks about her day and all the things she has to do when she gets home. When Jenna gets home, she is greeted by her mother and father. They ask her about her day and she tells them about her classes and what she learned. After they finish talking, Jenna heads to her room to do her homework. She starts working on her math assignment, but she can't focus. She keeps thinking about the animals she saw on her walk home and how different her life is from theirs. She wonders what it would be like to be one of them, to roam freely and not have to worry about school or homework. Jenna eventually falls asleep at her desk, dreaming of a life in the wild. In her dream, she is transformed into a lioness and she roams the savannah with her family. She hunts and plays and enjoys the freedom of being in the wild. When she wakes up, she realizes that she can't go back to sleep and she decides to go outside and explore her neighborhood. She knows she can't turn into a lioness, but she wants to feel the wind in her fur and the grass under her paws.
