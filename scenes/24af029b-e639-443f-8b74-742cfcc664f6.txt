The sun is setting over the gently rolling hills of the countryside, and the last of its rays are shining through the windows of the cozy cottage Swathi calls home. Inside, the young woman is curled up on the sofa with her laptop, working on the latest code for her employer. She's lost in concentration, and the only sound in the room is the soft tapping of her keyboard. Suddenly, the idyll is broken by the sound of a car pulling up outside. Swathi pauses her work, wondering who it could be at this time of day. She gets up from the sofa and goes to the window, peeking out from behind the curtains. She sees a black sedan parked in the driveway, and two men getting out of it. They're both wearing dark suits and sunglasses, and they look like they mean business. Swathi's heart sinks as she realizes they must be here for her. She quickly grabs her laptop and hides it under the cushions of the sofa, then goes to open the door. The men don't say anything as they push past her into the cottage, and Swathi's mind races as she wonders what they're going to do to her.
