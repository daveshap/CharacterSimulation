Jenna enters her bedroom and flops down on her bed. She stares up at the ceiling, lost in thought. Her mind is racing and she can't seem to focus on anything. She's trying to study for her upcoming biology test, but she can't seem to concentrate. Suddenly, her phone buzzes. She sits up and grabs it, eager for a distraction. It's a text from her best friend, asking if she wants to come over and hang out. Jenna responds quickly, saying she'll be right there. She stands up and grabs her jacket, then heads for the door. She paused for a moment, hand on the doorknob, and takes a deep breath. She can do this. She's just a little stressed, that's all. She can't let her anxiety get the best of her. She opens the door and steps out into the hallway, then heads for her friend's house.
