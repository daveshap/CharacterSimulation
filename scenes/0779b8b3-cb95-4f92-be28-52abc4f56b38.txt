Tom is cleaning up the bar area, wiping down the counters and straightening up the bar stools. It's been a long day and he's ready to go home. He's just about finished when he hears a commotion coming from one of the offices down the hall. He can't make out what's being said, but it sounds like someone is in a lot of pain. Tom knows he shouldn't get involved, but he can't just ignore it. He slowly makes his way down the hall towards the office, trying to stay out of sight. As he gets closer, he can hear a man's voice, high-pitched and panicked. Tom peekes into the office and sees a man lying on the floor, clutching his chest. It's clear he's having a heart attack. Tom knows he needs to act fast. He races into the office and kneels down next to the man. He can see that he's not breathing and his skin is starting to turn blue. Tom realizes he needs to perform CPR. He's never done it before, but he knows he can't just stand there and do nothing. Tom starts compressions, counting out loud as he goes. He breathes into the man's mouth and continues the compressions. Suddenly, the man starts coughing and gasping for air. Tom has saved his life. The man is obviously shaken and very grateful. Tom helps him to his feet and helps him back to his office. He calls 911 to make sure the man gets the medical attention he needs. Tom knows he's done a good thing, but he's also feeling shaken up. It's been a long day, and this was definitely not what he was expecting when he came to work.
