The city is bustling with energy and life as people hurry to and fro, enjoying the evening. Tom is behind the bar, mixing drinks and chatting with the customers. The air is thick with the smell of alcohol and cigarettes. The clinking of glasses and laughter fill the room. A group of young men come in and take a seat at the bar. They are rowdy and loud, ordering shots and beers. Tom serves them and they continue to drink and make noise. One of the men, slightly drunk, gets up from his stool and staggers over to a woman sitting at a nearby table. He starts to hit on her, making crude comments and trying to touch her. The woman is clearly uncomfortable and tries to get away, but the man is persistent. Tom sees what's happening and walks over to the man, telling him to leave the woman alone. The man starts to argue with Tom, getting in his face and threatening him. The other men at the bar get up and start to approach Tom. The situation is getting tense. Suddenly, the doors to the bar burst open and a group of police officers come in. They tell the men to calm down and to leave the premises. The men reluctantly do so, giving Tom dirty looks as they go. Tom breathes a sigh of relief and goes back to tending the bar.
