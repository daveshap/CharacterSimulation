Jenna is in the middle of a concert, surrounded by her friends. The music is blaring and the crowd is cheering. Jenna is dancing and singing along, having the time of her life. She's wearing her favorite band shirt and ripped jeans, and she has a glowstick in each hand. She's completely in the moment, lost in the music.
