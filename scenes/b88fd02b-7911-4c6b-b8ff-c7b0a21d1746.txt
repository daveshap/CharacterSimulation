Gabbi is walking down the street, pushing a stroller with a small child in it. The sun is shining and the sky is blue. Gabbi is wearing a brightly colored sundress and sandals. She is singing a nursery rhyme as she walks. The child in the stroller is giggling and clapping along with the rhythm of the song. As Gabbi walks, she passes by a group of teenage girls who are laughing and talking loudly. One of the girls notices Gabbi and the child and makes a face. Gabbi smiles and says hello. The girl looks away and the group continues on their way. Gabbi continues down the street, now singing a new song. She passes by a man who is sitting on a bench, reading a newspaper. The man smiles at Gabbi and the child as they go by. Gabbi turns onto a side street and starts to head back towards the child's home. She passes by a playground where several children are playing. Gabbi waves to the children and they wave back. Gabbi arrives at the child's home and rang the doorbell. The child's mother answers the door and thanks Gabbi for watching her child. Gabbi hands the mother the stroller and the child's mother gives Gabbi a kiss on the cheek. Gabbi says goodbye and starts to walk back down the street.
