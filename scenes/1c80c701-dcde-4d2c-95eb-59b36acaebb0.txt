It's Jenna's last night on the moon. She's been living here for the past year, as part of a research project to study the effects of long-term isolation. But now it's time to go home. Jenna has been feeling a bit homesick lately, and she's excited to see her family and friends again. But she's also a bit sad to leave this place that has been her home for so long. Tonight, Jenna is spending her last evening walking around the moonbase, saying goodbye to all the places and things that have been a part of her life here. She starts at the landing pad, where she first arrived on the moon. She remembers the excitement she felt when she first stepped out of the spaceship and saw the barren, grey landscape stretched out before her. She walks to the airlock and stares out at the stars for a while. She's going to miss the quiet beauty of the night sky. Next, she goes to the greenhouse, where she spent many hours working on her research project. She's going to miss the peaceful atmosphere of this place. Finally, Jenna goes to her bedroom. She stares at her empty bed, remembering all the nights she spent here, reading or looking at pictures of her family and friends back on Earth. Tomorrow, Jenna will be back on Earth. But tonight, she takes one last look around her home on the moon, saying goodbye to the place that has been her home for the past year.
