As the sun sets over Paris, the city's most iconic landmark comes to life. The Eiffel Tower is illuminated by thousands of twinkling lights, creating a magical atmosphere. Swathi, a software engineer from India, is visiting the city for the first time. She's been mesmerized by the tower all day, and now she's finally getting a chance to see it up close. Swathi approaches the tower, walking along the promenade that surrounds it. She can hear the faint strains of music coming from somewhere nearby, and she can see couples strolling hand in hand. The air is crisp and fresh, and the stars are beginning to come out. As she gets closer to the tower, Swathi can see that it's even more impressive than she'd imagined. She can't believe she's really here. She snaps some photos on her phone, then stands there for a moment, just taking it all in. Finally, she turns to walk back to her hotel. She knows she'll never forget this night.
