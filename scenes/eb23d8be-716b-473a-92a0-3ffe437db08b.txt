Jenna is sitting at her desk, munching on a Sandwich and scrolling through her phone. Suddenly, she hears a knock on her bedroom door. She gets up to answer it, and finds her mom standing there. "Hey, baby. I just wanted to check and see if you're okay. You seemed a little down at breakfast this morning." "I'm fine, mom. Just a little bit tired, that's all." "Okay, well I just wanted to check. I love you." "Love you too, mom." Jenna gives her mom a hug, and then mom heads back downstairs. Jenna sits down at her desk again, and goes back to scrolling through her phone.
