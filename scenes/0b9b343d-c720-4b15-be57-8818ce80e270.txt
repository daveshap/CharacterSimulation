The concert is in full swing, and the crowd is pumped. Swathi is in the middle of the mosh pit, surrounded by people jumping up and down and bumping into her. She'stotal!y in her element, headbanging away and singing along to the music. She's sweaty and dirty, and she doesn't care. This is the best night of her life.
