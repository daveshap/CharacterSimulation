As Jenna walks through the forest, she can feel the presence of something following her. She quickens her pace, but the rustling in the bushes only gets louder. Suddenly, a jaguar springs out in front of her, blocking her path. Jenna's heart races as she backs away slowly. The jaguar stalking her, ready to pounce. She knows she's not going to make it out of the forest alive.
