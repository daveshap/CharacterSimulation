Sandy is standing on a mountaintop in Europe, gazing out at the setting sun. She's been up here for hours, just soaking in the tranquility of the moment. It's been a long day and she's ready to head back down to the lodge, but she can't tear herself away from the view. The sun is verging on the horizon, painting the sky in a spectrum of oranges, pinks, and purples. The shadows of the mountains stretch out before her, and she can see the lights of the village flickering in the distance. A cool breeze brushes her face, and she takes a deep breath of the crisp, clean air. She feels so alive up here, surrounded by nature. It's a world away from the hustle and bustle of her everyday life back home. For a moment, she forgets all her troubles and just enjoys the peace and beauty of her surroundings. Eventually, Sandy tear herself away from the view and starts the long walk back down the mountain. She has a lot to think about and she knows she won't find the answers she's looking for up here, but it's nice to have a little break from reality every now and then.
