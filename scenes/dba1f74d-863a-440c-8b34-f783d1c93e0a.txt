Bob is standing in the middle of his coffee shop, surrounded by the detritus of the day'sbusiness. Chairs are upended on tables, half-empty cups of coffee sit forgotten, and paper wrappers and napkins are strewn everywhere. The only light comes from the neon sign above the door, which casts a garish, red glow over everything. Suddenly, the door swings open and a man stagger in. He's obviously drunk, and he's clutching a bottle of what smells like cheap bourbon. Bob takes a step back, warily eyeing the man. The man weaves his way over to the counter and slumps down onto a stool. He looks up at Bob with bleary eyes and slurs, "Coffee. Black. Make it strong." Bob hesitates for a moment, but then he nods and begins to brew a cup of coffee. As he does, he keeps a close eye on the man, who seems to be getting more and more agitated. Suddenly, he lashes out, smashing his bottle on the counter and sending glass and liquor everywhere. "That's it!" Bob yells, reaching for the bat he keeps behind the counter. "You're out of here!" The man tries to stand up, but he's too unsteady on his feet. Bob grabs him by the arm and drags him to the door, throwing him out into the night. As the door swings shut, Bob can hear the man's enraged, drunken shouts fading into the distance.
