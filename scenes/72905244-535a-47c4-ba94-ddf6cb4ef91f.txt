Gabbi is sitting on the beach, watching the sun set. The sky is a beautiful orange, and the waves are crashing against the shore. She is babysitting two children, who are playing in the sand nearby. Gabbi is thinking about her life and what she wants to do with it. She feels like she's at a crossroads and is not sure which path to take.
