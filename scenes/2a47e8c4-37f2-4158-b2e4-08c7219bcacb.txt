Wang is driving his delivery truck through the city streets. It is the middle of the night, but the city is still brightly lit. Wang is thinking about his family back home in China. He misses them dearly, but he knows that he must continue working to support them. As he drives, he notices a woman walking along the side of the road. She looks tired and dirty, as if she has been walking for a long time. Wang slows down and asks the woman if she needs help. The woman says that she is looking for a place to stay for the night. Wang tells her that she can stay in his truck. The woman is grateful and climbs into the passenger seat. Wang drives the woman to a nearby hotel and helps her get a room for the night. The woman thanks Wang and tells him that he is a good man. Wang simply nods and drives away.
