Gabbi arrived at the beach at 6pm. She was carrying a large beach bag and a, umbrella. She walked to where the family was sitting and put the umbrella in the sand. She greeted the family and took the baby from the mother. The father handed Gabbi a diaper bag and she put it over her shoulder. Gabbi walked with the baby to the water's edge. She sat down in the sand and began to change the baby's diaper. The baby cooed and gurgled as Gabbi changed him. After the diaper was changed, Gabbi put the baby on her lap and began to play with him. The baby grabbed her fingers and laughed. Gabbi tickled the baby's tummy and he giggled. The sun began to set and the sky turned a beautiful orange color. The waves crashing on the shore sounded like music to Gabbi and the baby. They sat there for a while, just watching the sun set. It was a beautiful evening.
