The scene is set in an office building in the early morning. Wang, a delivery driver, is making his rounds, dropping off packages and picking up outgoing mail. He's been working this route for a few years and knows all the employees by name. As he makes his way to the mail room, he sees one of the office workers, Ms. Nguyen, coming out of her office. She gives him a friendly wave and he returns the gesture. He then enters the mail room and starts sorting through the mail.
