The sun is beginning to set as Wang makes his way up the winding mountain road. He's been driving for hours, and he's starting to feel fatigued. But he knows he has to press on - he has an important delivery to make. As he nears the top of the mountain, the road becomes even more treacherous. He has to concentrate hard to keep the truck from slipping off the edge. Finally, he reaches his destination. A large, imposing castle perched atop the mountain. He has to ring a bell to announce his arrival, and then he's met by a butler who leads him inside. Wang is led through a series of dark, winding corridors until he finally arrives at his destination: a large, ornate room with a huge fireplace. Waiting for him is his client, a wealthy businessman. The businessman inspects the package Wang has delivered, and then hands him a envelope of cash. Wang thanks him and then makes his way back out to the truck. He's relieved to be finished with the delivery, and he can't wait to get back down the mountain and back to civilization.
