The concert is in full swing, the music is blasting and the crowd is going wild. Gabbi is in the middle of the mosh pit, surrounded by sweaty, half-naked bodies. She's bouncing around, headbanging and singing along to the music, lost in the moment. Suddenly, she feels a tap on her shoulder. She turns around to see a young girl, no more than eight years old, standing there. The girl looks terrified. Gabbi realises she's supposed to be babysitting this girl. She grabs her hand and tries to lead her out of the mosh pit, but the girl is too scared and won't move. Gabbi has no choice but to pick her up and carry her out of the crowd. As they make their way out, Gabbi can feel the girl shaking. She tries to reassure her that everything is going to be alright, but she's not sure if the girl understands. Finally, they make it out of the crowd and back to the girl's parents. The girl's mother scolds Gabbi for losing her daughter in the crowd, but the girl is just happy to be safe. Gabbi apologises and promises to be more careful in the future.
