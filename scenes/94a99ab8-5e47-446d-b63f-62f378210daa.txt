Wang is a delivery driver for the lunar base. It is 6pm and his shift is almost over. He is about to deliver a package to the last address on his route. Wang arrives at the address, a small dome on the edge of the base. He knocked on the door and is greeted by a women. She takes the package and thanks him. Wang is about to leave when he notices something strange. There is a light coming from inside the dome that shouldn't be there. He decides to investigate. Wang enters the dome and immediately notices that the walls are covered in a strange pink goo. He also sees that the woman is slumped over in a chair, apparently unconscious. Wang rushes to the woman's side to see if she is okay. He finds that she is still alive, but barely. She is mumbling something about "the pink goo." Wang realizes that he needs to get help. He runs back to the base to get help.
