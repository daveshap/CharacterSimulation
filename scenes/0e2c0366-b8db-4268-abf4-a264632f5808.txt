Swathi is a software engineer who works from home. It's mid-afternoon and she's just finishing up her work for the day. She's been sitting at her desk, staring at her computer screen for the past few hours, and she's starting to feel a bit drained. She gets up from her desk and stretches her arms above her head. She lets out a long sigh and rubs her tired eyes. As she does, she notices a few things around her bedroom that she hasn't noticed before. The cobwebs in the corner of the room, the dust on the dresser, the pile of clothes on the floor... she's been so busy with work lately that she's let her own personal space become a bit of a mess. Swathi decides to take a break from work and tidy up her bedroom. She starts by making her bed, then she picks up the clothes off the floor and put them away. She dusts off the dresser and the windowsill, and sweeps the floor. After a few minutes of work, her bedroom looks much better. Swathi feels better too. She's not as tired as she was before, and she's taken a small step towards taking better care of herself.
