Wang has just arrived at the beach. It is early morning, and the sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon. The air is still and the water is calm. Wang begins to unload his delivery of goods from the truck. He stacking the crates of seafood onto a small cart, which he will wheel down to the shoreline. As he works, Wang can hear the sound of waves crashing against the shore. He can also smell the salt in the air. He takes a moment to appreciate the beauty of the scene before him. The colors of the sky and the water are simply stunning. Wang finishes unloading the seafood and wheels the cart down to the water's edge. He begins to set up his stall, laying out a tablecloth and setting out the seafood. He knows that the early morning customers will be coming soon, and he wants to be ready.
