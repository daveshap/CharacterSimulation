Sandy is a stay-at-home mom who is currently in her husband's office building. It is evening time and the building is mostly empty. Sandy is feeling a bit lost and confused as she is not used to being in such an environment. She is slowly making her way down the hall, looking at the various doors and businesses that are located inside the building. She is unsure of where she is supposed to go or what she is supposed to do. As she is walking, she hears a noise coming from one of the offices. She slowly approaches the door and peeks inside. She sees a man inside, pacing back and forth. It looks like he is on the phone and seems to be in the middle of a heated argument. Sandy is not sure what to do, so she just stands there and watches the man.
