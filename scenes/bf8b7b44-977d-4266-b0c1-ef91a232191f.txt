Bob is sitting in the middle of a crowded concert hall, surrounded by people chatting and laughing. He looks a little out of place, like he's not quite sure why he's there. He's holding a cup of coffee and looking around nervously. Suddenly, the lights dim and the concert begins. Bob is startled by the sudden change in atmosphere and looks around, wide-eyed. He watches the performers on stage for a moment, before starting to feel restless. He takes a sip of his coffee and looks around again, before getting up and leaving the concert hall.
