The Eiffel Tower stands tall and imposing against the night sky. Its steel beams are cold and unforgiving. Mashawn climbs up one of the beams, his hands and feet numbed by the cold. He's been working construction on the tower for months, and he knows every inch of it. He's also one of the few people who is brave enough to scale the tower in the middle of the night. Mashawn's destination is the top of the tower. He's not sure why he's drawn to it, but there's something about the view from the top that calls to him. Maybe it's because he can see the whole city from up there. Maybe it's because it makes him feel like he's on top of the world. Whatever the reason, Mashawn knows that he has to make it to the top. The climb is treacherous, and more than once Mashawn slips and nearly falls. But he finally makes it to the top, and the view takes his breath away. He can see the entire city stretched out before him, lights twinkling in the distance. He feels like he could stay there forever. But Mashawn knows he can't. He has to get back down before anyone sees him. It's not safe to be up here, and he could get in a lot of trouble if he's caught. So he takes one last look at the view and then starts the long climb back down.
