Jenna walks through the park, admiring the view of the Eiffel Tower. She's never been to Paris before and is in awe of the city around her. She notices a guy sitting on a bench, and she can't help but stare at him. He's tall, with dark hair and piercing blue eyes. She feels a sudden urge to talk to him, and she nervously approaches the bench. "Hi, um, do you speak English?" she asks, blushing slightly. He grins and nods, and they start talking. They discover that they have a lot in common, and they end up sitting on the bench for hours, talking and laughing. As the sun sets, he takes her hand and they walk to the top of the Eiffel Tower, where they watch the city lights come alive. Jenna knows that she's going to remember this night for the rest of her life.
