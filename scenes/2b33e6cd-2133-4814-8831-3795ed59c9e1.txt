It's mid-afternoon and Bob is up on the mountaintop, enjoying the view. He's got his coffee shop up and running and he's doing a pretty good business. He's got a great view of the valley below and he can see for miles. He's got a few customers, but not many. He's just enjoying the peace and quiet when he hears a noise. He looks over and sees a group of people coming up the path. They're laughing and joking and having a good time. Bob knows them pretty well - they're a group of tourists who come up to his shop every year. They're always friendly and they always buy a lot of coffee. Bob waves to them and they wave back. They start to come up the path to his shop and he can see that they're carrying a bunch of gear. They're probably going to be staying up here for a while. Bob gets up and goes to meet them. He's glad to see them and he knows they're going to be good customers. He'll make sure they have a great stay up on the mountaintop.
