Tom is taking a break from work and is in his bedroom. He is sitting on his bed with a sandwich in hand. His TV is on and he is flipping through the channels. He stops on a news channel and starts to watch. After a few minutes, he gets up and turns off the TV. He goes to his dresser and takes out a envelope. He sits back on the bed and looks at the envelope.
