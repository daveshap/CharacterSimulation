Mashawn is at a concert in the early morning hours. He is surrounded by people who are drunk and disorderly. The music is loud and the atmosphere is wild. Mashawn is not having a good time. He is trying to make his way through the crowd, but people are bumping into him and spilling beer on him. He is getting angry and is about to leave when he sees a girl who is alone and seems to be lost. He goes over to her and asks if she is okay. She says she is lost and needs help. Mashawn takes her by the hand and leads her out of the crowd. He takes her to his car and drives her home.
