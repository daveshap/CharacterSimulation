It's a cold, clear night, and Swathi is standing on the top of a mountain in Europe. She's wrapped in a warm coat, but she still shivers slightly in the frigid air. She's looking up at the stars, and she's marveling at their beauty. She's been working on a software project for the past few weeks, and she's finally finished it. She's feeling proud of her accomplishment, and she's feeling grateful for the opportunity to work on such an interesting project.
