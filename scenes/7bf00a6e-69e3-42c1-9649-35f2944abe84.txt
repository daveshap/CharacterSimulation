Mashawn is a construction worker who has just finished a long day on the job. He's looking forward to relaxing in his peaceful country cottage in the middle of the night. But as he approaches the cottage, he sees a strange light coming from inside. He slowly opens the door to find a group of ghosts dancing around the room. They're laughing and having a good time, and they don't seem to notice him. Mashawn is shocked at first, but then he starts to feel like he's intruding on their fun. He's about to leave when one of the ghosts sees him and starts to scream. The other ghosts stop dancing and turn to look at him. They start to advance on him, and Mashawn realizes he's in trouble. He runs out of the cottage and back to his car, and he doesn't look back until he's safely on the road.
