The sun is just peeking over the horizon, and the sky is ablaze with colors. The mountaintop is blanketed in a layer of mist, which Swathi can see start to dissipate as the sun's rays grow stronger. She's been hiking for hours, and she's finally reached her destination. The view from the top is incredible, and she can see for miles in all directions. She can't help but feel a sense of accomplishment as she looks out over the landscape. The air is crisp and clean, and she can feel the freshness of it fill her lungs. She takes a deep breath and savors the moment. It's going to be a beautiful day.
