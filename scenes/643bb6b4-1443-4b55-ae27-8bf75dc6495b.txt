The sun was setting behind the mountains, and the air was getting chilly. Swathi had been hiking all day and was ready to find a place to camp for the night. She spotted a clearing on a mountaintop not too far away and headed towards it. As she got closer, she could see that there was a small cabin in the clearing. She approached it and knocked on the door. There was no answer. She tried the handle, and the door was unlocked. She stepped inside and looked around. The cabin was small and cozy, with a fireplace in one corner. There was a bed in the other corner, and a table in the middle of the room. Swathi decided to make herself at home and started a fire in the fireplace. She was just starting to feel warm when she heard a noise outside. She got up to investigate and saw a group of people walking towards the cabin. They looked like they were carrying supplies and camping gear. Swathi went back inside and hid under the bed. She was terrified of what might happen if they found her. She could hear them coming into the cabin, and she held her breath, hoping they wouldn't find her.
