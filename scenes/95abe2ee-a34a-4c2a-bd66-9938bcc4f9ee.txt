Gabbi, a babysitter, is walking down a brightly lit city street. It is 6pm and the sun is still out. Gabbi is carrying a small bag and has a phone in her hand. She is walking quickly and tapping on her phone. She turns a corner and almost bumps into a woman who is walking with a stroller. The woman apologizes and Gabbi continues on her way. She comes to a stop in front of a building and looks up at the address. She checks her phone again and then presses the buzzer. A moment later, she is let into the building. She takes the elevator up to the fifth floor and walks down the hall to apartment 5B. She knocks on the door and a woman's voice can be heard from inside, telling her to come in. Gabbi enters the apartment and is greeted by a woman who is holding a baby. The woman thanks Gabbi for coming and hands her the baby. Gabbi begins to rock the baby and coo at it. The woman watchs for a moment and then goes into another room. Gabbi continues to rock the baby and talk to it softly. After a few minutes, the baby falls asleep. Gabbi gently lays the baby in its crib and then goes into the kitchen to start dinner.
