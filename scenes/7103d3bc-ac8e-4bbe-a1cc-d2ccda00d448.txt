The sun is just beginning to set as Mashawn walks up the path to his cottage. He's been working all day and is looking forward to relax in his comfortable home. As he unlocks the door, he is greeted by the warm, inviting atmosphere of the cottage. He immediately feels at ease as he steps inside. The living room is cozy and inviting, with a fire crackling in the fireplace. Mashawn heads to the kitchen to pour himself a glass of wine. As he sips his wine, he looks out the window at the tranquil setting. He can see the ducks swimming in the pond and the flowers blooming in the garden. He takes a deep breath and smiles, feeling thankful for this moment of peace.
