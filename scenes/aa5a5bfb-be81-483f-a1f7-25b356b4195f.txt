It's a dark, moonless night. Jenna is standing on the surface of the moon, her spacecraft parked nearby. She's wearing a spacesuit and carrying a flashlight. In the distance, she can see the Earth, a bright blue and white sphere hanging in the black sky. Jenna is on a school field trip, and she's been exploring the lunar surface for the past few hours. She's excited to be here, but also a little bit scared. She's never been so far from home before. Right now, Jenna is taking a break. She's sitting on a rock, resting her tired feet. She's been walking around for hours, and she's ready for a rest. She shines her flashlight around, looking at the dark, barren landscape. She's never seen anything like it before. Suddenly, Jenna hears a noise. It's a strange, ethereal sound, like something she's never heard before. She shines her light in the direction of the noise, but she can't see anything. She's starting to feel a little bit scared. Jenna gets to her feet and starts to walk back to her spacecraft. She's moving quickly now, her heart racing. She's never felt so alone before. As she gets closer to her spacecraft, she starts to feel a bit better. She's almost there. Suddenly, Jenna hears the noise again. It's louder this time, and it's coming from behind her. She turns around, shining her light in the direction of the noise. And that's when she sees it. There, standing in the darkness, is a creature. It's tall and thin, with long, spindly legs. It has no eyes, just a mouth full of sharp teeth. Jenna screams as the creature comes towards her. She turns and runs towards her spacecraft. She has to get inside. She has to get away from this creature. She's never been so scared in her life. Jenna reaches the spacecraft and fumbles with the door handle. She's shaking so hard, she can barely get the door open. She finally manages to get inside and slam the door shut. The creature is pounding on the door, trying to get in. Jenna is terrified. She doesn't know what to do. She's never felt so scared in her life.
