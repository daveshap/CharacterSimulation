The babysitter, Gabbi, was in the office building when she received a call from the parents of the children she was supposed to be babysitting. They told her that they would be home late and asked her to stay with the kids until they got back. Gabbi agreed and went to the children's room to check on them. They were both asleep, so she decided to watch TV in the living room. After a while, she started to feel tired and decided to lay down on the couch. She must have fallen asleep, because the next thing she knew, she was being shaken awake by the children's father. He told her that they had been home for a while and asked her why she hadn't come to get them. Gabbi apologized and explained that she must have fallen asleep. The father wasn't happy, but Gabbi assured him that she would be more careful in the future. He thanked her for watching the children and she left.
