Swathi is standing on the surface of the moon, gazing up at the stars. She feels a sense of wonder and awe at the sight of the vast expanse of space above her. She is also excited and proud to be standing on the moon, as it is a place that few humans have ever had the chance to visit. The air is thin and cold, and Swathi can feel the harshness of the environment. She is wearing a space suit to protect her from the hostile conditions. She is standing near the site where her team has been working to build a new lunar base. The base is not yet completed, but Swathi and her team have made great progress. She looks around at the barren landscape, imagining what it will be like when the base is finished. She is excited to be a part of this historic project.
