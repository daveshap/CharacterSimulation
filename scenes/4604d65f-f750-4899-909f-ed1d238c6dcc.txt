Mashawn is walking along the beach, admiring the sunset. He's been working hard all day and is looking forward to relax. As he approaches a quiet spot, he notices something shining in the sand. He bends down to pick it up, and it's a gold necklace. He looks around to see if anyone is nearby, but there's no one in sight. He puts the necklace in his pocket and continues walking.
