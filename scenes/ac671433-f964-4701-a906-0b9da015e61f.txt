The sun is setting and Gabbi is getting ready to put the kids to bed. She's been babysitting them all day and they're finally starting to calm down. Gabbi is looking forward to having a few hours to herself after they're asleep. She tucks the kids into bed and kisses them goodnight. Then she heads to the living room to watch TV and relax. She's just starting to get comfortable when she hears a noise from the kids' room. Gabbi gets up to investigate and finds that one of the kids is out of bed and rummaging through the toy box. She scolds the child and puts them back to bed. Then she goes back to the living room and tries to relax again. But a few minutes later, she hears the noise again. This time, she finds both of the kids out of bed and playing with their toys. She scolds them again and puts them back to bed. This time, she decides to stay in the room and watch them to make sure they stay in bed. She's exhausted from a long day of work and just wants to go to bed herself. But she knows she has to stay awake a bit longer to make sure the kids are safe.
