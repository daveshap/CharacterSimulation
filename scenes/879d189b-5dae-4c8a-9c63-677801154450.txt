It is mid-afternoon in a dark forest in South America. Mashawn, a construction worker, is walking through the forest, when he hears a noise in the bushes. He draws his knife and approaches cautiously. Suddenly, a group of men jump out from behind the bushes, yelling and brandishing clubs. Mashawn tries to run, but they quickly catch up to him and begin to beat him. He falls to the ground, unconscious. The men take his knife and wallet, and then disappear back into the forest.
