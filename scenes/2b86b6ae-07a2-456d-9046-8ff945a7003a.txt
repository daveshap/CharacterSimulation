It's dusk, and the Eiffel Tower is aglow with the setting sun. Wang, a delivery driver, is making his rounds when he notices a group of teenagers gossiping and laughing near the base of the tower. He can't help but overhear their conversation; they're talking about a party that's happening tonight. Wang knows that he can't go to the party - he has to work - but he can't help but feel a twinge of envy. He's never been to the Eiffel Tower before, and he can't help but wonder what it would be like to see the city at night from such a high vantage point. As he continues on his rounds, Wang can't help but keep stealing glances at the tower. Finally, when he's finished for the night, he decides to take a closer look. He approaches the group of teenagers and asks them for directions. The teenagers are a bit suspicious at first, but Wang is friendly and persistent. Eventually, they give in and tell him how to get to the top of the tower. Wang thanks them and sets off. He takes the elevator to the top, and the views are even more breathtaking than he could have imagined. He can see the whole city stretched out before him, and the lights are twinkling like stars. Wang feels like he's on top of the world. It's an unforgettable experience, and he knows that he'll never forget the night he spent under the Eiffel Tower.
