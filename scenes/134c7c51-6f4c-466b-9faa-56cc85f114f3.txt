Gabbi is sitting at her desk in the office, surrounded by piles of papers. She looks up as the door opens and a woman walks in. The woman is holding a baby. Gabbi smiles and gets up from her desk. "Hello, Mrs. Saunders. How are you today?" "I'm fine, thank you," Mrs. Saunders replies. "I'm just here to drop off my son, Joshua. His babysitter cancelled on me last minute, so I was wondering if you could watch him for a couple of hours." "Of course," Gabbi says. "I would be happy to." She takes Joshua from Mrs. Saunders and settles him in a nearby playpen. Joshua starts to cry, but Gabbi quickly picks him up and starts to rock him. "There, there," she murmurs. "It's okay. Gabbi's here." Soon, Joshua is calm and happy, playing contentedly with his toys. Gabbi watches him with a smile on her face, her heart warming at the sight of the happy little boy.
