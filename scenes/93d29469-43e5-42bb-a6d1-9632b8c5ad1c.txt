Bob is a coffee shop owner who often takes walks on the beach to clear his head. Tonight, he's out for a walk in the middle of the night, enjoying the peace and quiet. He's not expecting to see anyone else out at this time, but he's not surprised when he sees a figure in the distance. As he gets closer, he realizes that it's a woman, and she looks to be in distress. She's frantically looking around, as if she's lost something. Bob approaches her and asks if she's okay. The woman is clearly distraught. She tells Bob that she's lost her wedding ring. She and her husband had been taking a walk on the beach earlier and she took her ring off to wash her hands in the ocean. But when she went to put it back on, it was gone. Bob offers to help her look for it. They spend the next hour combing the area, but they don't find the ring. Bob tells her that he's sorry, but he doesn't think they'll be able to find it in the dark. The woman is visibly upset. She thanks Bob for his help, and then she turns and walks away. Bob watches her go, feeling helpless. He knows how much that ring meant to her and he wishes he could have found it.
