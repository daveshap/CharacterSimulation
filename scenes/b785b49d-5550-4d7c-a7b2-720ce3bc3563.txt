It's evening, and the lights of the Eifel Tower are just starting to come on. Jenna is standing at the base of the tower, looking up at it in wonder. She's never seen anything like it before. She's here on a school trip, and she's been looking forward to it for months. She's never been out of her home country before, and she's excited to see all the sights. The tower is even more impressive up close. She can't believe she's actually here. She takes a few pictures, then starts to walk around, taking everything in. There's a group of other students nearby, laughing and joking. They seem to be having a great time. Jenna smiles, feeling happy to be here. Suddenly, she hears a loud noise. She turns around to see the Eifel Tower collapsing. It falls to the ground with a deafening crash, sending dust and debris everywhere. Jenna is frozen in shock. She can't believe what she's seeing. The Eifel Tower, one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, is now a pile of rubble. People are screaming and running around in panic. Jenna is still in shock, and she can't move. She just stands there, staring at the wreckage. Eventually, someone comes and leads her away. She can't take her eyes off the tower, and the image of it collapsing will stay with her forever.
