Jenna is lying in bed, asleep. It's the middle of the night, and the only sound is the soft breathing of her sleeping dog next to the bed. All is peaceful and calm. Suddenly, Jenna is awoken by a loud noise outside. She sits up in bed, heart racing, and listens carefully. There are footsteps on the porch, and someone is trying to open the door. Jenna is terrified. She doesn't know what to do. Should she hide under the bed? Should she call the police? Just as she's about to make a decision, the door bursts open and a masked figure bursts into the room. Jenna screams and tries to run, but the intruder is too quick. He grabs her and puts a hand over her mouth to silence her. Jenna struggles and panics, but she knows she's in trouble. The intruder drags Jenna out of the bedroom and into the living room, where he pushes her down onto the couch. He ties her hands and feet with rope, and then he starts to search the house. Jenna is scared and helpless. She doesn't know what the intruder is looking for, or what he's going to do to her when he finds it. She can only wait and hope that someone will come to help her before it's too late.
