Wang is driving his delivery truck through a dark forest in South America. He is mid-way through his delivery route when he notices something strange up ahead. It looks like there is a large object blocking the road. As he gets closer, he realizes that it is a fallen tree. There is no way around it. Wang decides to try to move the tree himself. He gets out of the truck and tries to push the tree off the road. But it is too heavy. He tries to climb the tree to see if he can get a better grip, but he slips and falls to the ground. He hurts his leg in the fall. Wang is now stuck in the forest, with no way to move the tree and no way to call for help. He is going to have to spend the night in the forest.
