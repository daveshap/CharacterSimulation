In the dark forest in South America, it is the middle of the night. Swathi, a software engineer, is walking through the forest, carrying a large bag over her shoulder. It is difficult to see in the darkness, and Swathi is careful to avoid the trees and roots that can trip her up. She is looking for a specific spot in the forest, and she knows that it is getting close. Suddenly, she hears a noise behind her, and she turns around to see a large, furry creature standing there, watching her. Swathi's heart races, and she starts to back away slowly. The creature begins to move closer to her, and Swathi realizes that it is a jaguar. She knows that she is in danger, and she starts to run. The jaguar is faster than her, and it soon catches up to her. Swathi feels its teeth sinking into her flesh, and she knows that she is going to die. She feels the jaguar dragging her into the darkness, and then everything goes black.
