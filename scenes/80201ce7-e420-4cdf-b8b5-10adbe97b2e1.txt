Tom was tending to the bar when he heard a knock at the door. He went to answer it and found a beautiful woman standing before him. She introduced herself as Sarah and said she was looking for a place to stay for the night. Tom told her she was welcome to stay at the cottage and showed her to a room. Sarah was tired from her journey and went to lie down. Tom got her a glass of water and left her to rest. As he was walking back to the bar, he heard a scream coming from Sarah's room. He ran to her and found her lying on the floor in a pool of blood. Tom quickly called for help, but it was too late. Sarah had been stabbed to death.
