The sun is setting behind the trees, casting a warm glow over the cottage. Bob is sitting on the porch, enjoying a cup of coffee. The birds are chirping and the breeze is blowing through the leaves. Everything is peaceful and serene. Suddenly, the sound of a car engine breaks the silence. Bob gets up and walks to the edge of the porch, peering down the road. A moment later, a car comes into view, kicking up a cloud of dust as it comes to a stop in front of the cottage. The door opens and a woman gets out. She's carrying a suitcase and looks weary from travel. Bob comes down the steps to greet her. "Welcome home, dear," he says, giving her a hug. "It's good to be home," she replies, smiling. They go inside, arm in arm, and the door closes behind them, leaving the cottage peaceful and quiet once again.
