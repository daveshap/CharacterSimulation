Aleksy is sitting at his desk, tapping his fingers against the surface as he looks around the office. It's a typical day at work, and he's getting a little bit bored. He's been working as a grocery store clerk for the past year, and he's starting to feel like he's in a rut. Suddenly, the door to his office opens and his boss walks in. Aleksy sits up straighter in his chair, trying to look attentive. His boss begins to speak, and Aleksy's mind starts to wander. He doesn't really care what his boss is saying, and he tune out the words. Suddenly, he hears his name. His boss is asking him a question, and Aleksy has no idea what the answer is. He stutters for a moment, trying to come up with something, but his mind is blank. His boss looks annoyed, and Aleksy knows he's in for a scolding.
