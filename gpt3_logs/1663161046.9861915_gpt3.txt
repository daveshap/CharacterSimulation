The creature is standing on its hind legs and is taller than the truck. It has long, sharp claws and is glaring at me with its bright eyes. My heart is racing and I am terrified. I do not know what to do. The creature takes a step towards the truck and I frantically try to think of a way to escape. Suddenly, I have an idea.
