Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Mashawn had been working long hours at the construction site and was exhausted. He had just finished his shift and was looking forward to getting some rest. He entered his bedroom and was about to lie down on his bed when he heard a noise coming from the other side of the room. He froze and listened carefully, trying to determine what it was. It sounded like someone was moving around in the room. He slowly got up from the bed and quietly walked across the room, careful not to make any noise. He reached the door and slowly moved his hand towards the doorknob, heart racing as he prepared to confront the intruder. He turned the knob and swung the door open, ready to confront whoever was inside. However, the room was empty. There was no one there. He looked around the room, confused and trying to figure out what was going on. Then he heard the noise again, coming from the closet. He walked towards the closet and opened the door. Inside, he found a small creature moving around. It was a mouse! He sighed in relief and laughed at himself for being so scared. He reached down and scooped the mouse up into his hand, taking it outside to release it into the night.

I had been working long hours at the construction site and was exhausted. I had just finished my shift and was looking forward to getting some rest. I entered my bedroom and was about to lie down on my bed when I heard a noise coming from the other side of the room. I froze and listened carefully, trying to determine what it was. It sounded like someone was moving around in the room. I slowly got up from the bed and quietly walked across the room, careful not to make any noise. I reached the door and slowly moved my hand towards the doorknob, heart racing as I prepared to confront the intruder. I turned the knob and swung the door open, ready to confront whoever was inside. However, the room was empty. There was no one there. I looked around the room, confused and trying to figure out what was going on. Then I heard the noise again, coming from the closet.
