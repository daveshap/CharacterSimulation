Suddenly, his cell phone rings. He looks down at the screen and sees that it's his coffee shop. He hesitates for a moment, but then decides to answer. "Hello? Yes, this is Bob. What can I do for you?" He listens for a moment, a look of concern spreading across his face. "Oh no, that's not good. I'll be right there." He hangs up the phone and starts to make his way through the crowd, apologizing as he bumps into people. He's obviously in a hurry, and people are starting to notice. "Excuse me, excuse me. I'm sorry, I have to go." He finally makes it to the edge of the crowd and starts to run. He's obviously worried about something.
