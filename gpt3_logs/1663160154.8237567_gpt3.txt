SCENE: Bob is walking through a dark forest in South America, carrying a large bag of coffee beans. He is sweating profusely and panting from the heat and the effort of carrying the heavy bag. He is also very tired, and his feet are hurting from all the walking. Suddenly, he hears a noise behind him, and he turns around to see a large snake slithering towards him. Bob is terrified, and he drops the bag of beans and runs away as fast as he can. The snake is right behind him, and it is about to strike when Bob trips over a log and falls to the ground. The snake strikes, and its fangs sink into Bob's arm. Bob screams in pain as the snake begins to coil itself around him, constricting his chest and making it difficult to breathe. Bob knows he is going to die if he doesn't do something, so he takes his knife and stabs it into the snake's head. The snake releases its grip on Bob and writhes in pain on the ground. Bob gets up and runs away as fast as he can. He is safe now, but he knows he won't forget the harrowing experience of being attacked by a snake in the forest.

The snake strikes, and its fangs sink into my arm. I scream in pain as the snake begins to coil itself around me, constricting my chest and making it difficult to breathe.
