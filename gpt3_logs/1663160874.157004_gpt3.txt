It's the middle of the night, and I'm huddled in the corner of my office building, trying to stay warm. I've been here for hours, ever since I got locked out of my apartment. I've tried everything to get back in, but the doors are all locked and I can't find a way to climb up to my window. I'm starting to feel really cold and hungry, and I'm starting to worry that I'm going to have to spend the night here.
