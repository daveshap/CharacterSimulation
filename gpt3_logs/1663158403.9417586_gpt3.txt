The sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon as I heft my heavy backpack onto my shoulders. I've been up for hours already, getting the kids ready for their day out. Now it's time for me to head to my own destination - the Eiffel Tower. I've always loved coming to this spot. It's so peaceful in the early morning, with only a few other people around. I like to sit on the grass and watch the sun rise over the city. Today, however, there's something different in the air. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. I quicken my pace as I approach the tower. Suddenly, I see it. A flash of gold at the top of the Eiffel Tower. I can't believe my eyes - it's a real live unicorn! I watch, enchanted, as the magical creature prances around the tower. This is definitely the most magical moment of my life. I know I'll never forget it.
