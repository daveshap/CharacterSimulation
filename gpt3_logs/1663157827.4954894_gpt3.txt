Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Jenna walks down the busy sidewalk, her backpack straps cutting into her shoulders. The sun is beating down on her, and she can feel the sweat trickling down her back. She's on her way to meet her friends for lunch, and she can't wait to get out of the heat. As she approaches the restaurant, she sees her friends sitting at a table near the window. They wave her over, and she eagerly makes her way inside. She slides into the seat next to her best friend, Katie, and lets out a sigh of relief. "It's so hot out there," she says, fanning herself with her hand. "I know," Katie responds. "I can't wait for summer to be over." Jenna nods in agreement as she opens the menu. She knows she won't be able to eat much in this heat, but she's determined to at least try.

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I walk down the busy sidewalk, my backpack straps cutting into my shoulders. The sun is beating down on me, and I can feel the sweat trickling down my back. I'm on my way to meet my friends for lunch, and I can't wait to get out of the heat. As I approach the restaurant, I see my friends sitting at a table near the window. They wave me over, and I eagerly make my way inside. I slide into the seat next to my best friend, Katie, and let out a sigh of relief. "It's so hot out there," I say, fanning myself with my hand. "I know," Katie responds. "I can't wait for summer to be over." I nod in agreement as I open the menu. I know I won't be able to eat much in this heat, but I'm determined to at least try.
