Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Mashawn is working the night shift on the construction site of a new moon base. He's been working long hours for weeks, and he's starting to feel the effects of the constant labor. His muscles are sore, his mind is foggy, and his vision is beginning to blur. Suddenly, Mashawn hears a loud noise coming from the other side of the site. He grabs his flashlight and runs towards the sound, heart pounding in his chest. As he approaches, he sees a shadowy figure running away from the scene of a recent break-in. Mashawn gives chase, but the figure is too quick and soon disappears into the darkness. Mashawn returns to the site of the break-in, heart still racing. He shines his flashlight around, trying to see what was taken. It looks like some equipment and supplies were stolen from one of the storage containers. Mashawn reports the break-in to his supervisor, and a search is launched for the culprit. But whoever it was knows the layout of the construction site better than anyone, and they're long gone by the time the search begins.

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I'm working the night shift on the construction site of a new moon base. I've been working long hours for weeks, and I'm starting to feel the effects of the constant labor. My muscles are sore, my mind is foggy, and my vision is beginning to blur. Suddenly, I hear a loud noise coming from the other side of the site. I grab my flashlight and run towards the sound, heart pounding in my chest. As I approach, I see a shadowy figure running away from the scene of a recent break-in. I give chase, but the figure is too quick and soon disappears into the darkness. I return to the site of the break-in, heart still racing. I shine my flashlight around, trying to see what was taken. It looks like some equipment and supplies were stolen from one of the storage containers. I report the break-in to my supervisor, and a search is launched for the culprit. But whoever it was knows the layout of the construction site better than anyone, and they're long gone by the time the search begins.
