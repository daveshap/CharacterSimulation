I was finishing up my shift as a delivery driver and all I wanted to do was go home to my family. I was exhausted from a long day of driving, but I was almost done. I walked to my car, which was parked under the Eiffel Tower, and was just about to get in when I saw a group of people approaching. The group was composed of a few men and women of various ages, all of whom looked tired and worn down. I recognized one of the men as a regular customer at the restaurant where I worked. He was carrying a large backpack and stopped in front of me, looking me in the eye. "I need your help," he said. "We're trying to get to the top of the Eiffel Tower, but we don't have enough money to buy tickets. Can you spare some change?" I looked at the group and saw the desperation in their eyes. I knew that it would be dangerous for them to try to climb the tower without tickets, so I decided to help them. I reached into my pocket and took out all the money I had. "Here," I said, handing the money to the man. "This should be enough to get you to the top." The man thanked me profusely and the group started to make their way towards the tower. I watched them go, hoping that they would make it to the top safely.
