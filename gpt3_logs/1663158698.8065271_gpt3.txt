Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Mashawn climbs to the top of the mountain, his construction tools slung over his shoulder. He's been working on the new resort for weeks, and he's finally reached the summit. The sun is just starting to set, and the view is breathtaking. Mashawn can see for miles in every direction, and the air is crisp and clean. He can't help but feel a sense of accomplishment as he looks at the progress he and his team have made. Suddenly, Mashawn hears a noise behind him. He turns to see a large, furry creature standing on the edge of the cliff, watching him. Mashawn's heart races as he realizes he's face-to-face with a bear. For a moment, the two of them just stare at each other. Then, the bear lets out a loud roar and charges towards Mashawn. Mashawn doesn't have time to think. He instinctively drops his tools and runs for his life. The bear is right on his heels, but Mashawn manages to make it to safety just in time. He looks back at the bear, still standing on the edge of the cliff, and can't believe he just survived. That was a close call, he thinks to himself, as he starts the long climb back down the mountain.

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I was climbing to the top of the mountain, my construction tools slung over my shoulder. I'd been working on the new resort for weeks, and I'd finally reached the summit. The sun was just starting to set, and the view was breathtaking. I could see for miles in every direction, and the air was crisp and clean. I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment as I looked at the progress I and my team had made. Suddenly, I heard a noise behind me. I turned to see a large, furry creature standing on the edge of the cliff, watching me. My heart raced as I realized I was face-to-face with a bear. For a moment, the two of us just stared at each other. Then, the bear let out a loud roar and charged towards me. I didn't have time to think. I instinctively dropped my tools and ran for my life. The bear was right on my heels, but I managed to make it to safety just in time. I looked back at the bear, still standing on the edge of the cliff, and couldn't believe I'd just survived. That was a close call, I thought to myself, as I started the long climb back down the mountain.
