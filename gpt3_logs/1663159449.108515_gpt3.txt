I'm at the concert in the park, surrounded by people of all ages. We're all dancing and singing along to the music. The sun is shining and the atmosphere is festive. I'm tapping my foot along to the beat, clapping my hands when the chorus comes in. I'm not really paying attention to the lyrics, but I know the melody and it's catchy. I look around at the people around me and see that they're all smiling and having a good time. The concert goes on for a few more hours and I'm having a great time. I'm starting to feel a bit tired, but I don't want to leave just yet. I'm not sure if I'm going to stay for the whole thing, but I'm enjoying myself for now.
