==========

I walk into my bedroom, yawning and stretching my arms. I've had a long day at work and I'm looking forward to getting some rest. I kick off my shoes and climb into bed, pulling the covers up to my chin. I close my eyes, but after a few minutes, I start to feel restless. I toss and turn, but I can't seem to get comfortable. I get out of bed and go to the window, opening the curtains and letting in some fresh air. I look out at the street below, studying the cars and people as they go about their evening. After a few minutes, I feel calmer and I climb back into bed. I close my eyes and finally fall asleep.
