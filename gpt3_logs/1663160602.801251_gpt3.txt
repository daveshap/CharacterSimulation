It's a peaceful scene, and Bob feels lucky to be able to live and work in such a beautiful place. As he's watching, Bob sees a figures come over the top of the mountain and start down the other side. It's a hiker, he assumes, out for a evening walk. He watches the figure for a while, until they disappear out of view. A few minutes later, Bob sees another figure come over the top of the mountain. This one is moving much faster than the first, and Bob can see that they're carrying something. It looks like a backpack, and they're headed down the mountain at a pretty good clip.

After a few minutes, he goes back to work, cleaning up the shop for the night.

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I was watching the sun set behind the mountains from my coffee shop when I saw a figure come over the top of the mountain and start down the other side. I assumed it was a hiker out for an evening walk. I watched the figure for a while, until they disappeared out of view. A few minutes later, I saw another figure come over the top of the mountain. This one was moving much faster than the first, and I could see that they were carrying something. It looked like a backpack, and they were headed down the mountain at a pretty good clip. I wondered if the second hiker was chasing the first, or if they were just in a hurry to get somewhere. I continued to watch the mountain, but I didn't see any more hikers. After a few minutes, I went back to work, cleaning up the shop for the night.
