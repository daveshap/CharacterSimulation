The forest is eerily quiet as I make my way through the trees. I have been walking for hours and am now quite lost. My only hope is to find my way back to the coffee shop where I left my phone. I know my wife will be worried about me. Suddenly, I hear a branch snap behind me. I whips around, heart pounding, but there is nothing there. I am sure I am being watched but can't see anything in the dense foliage. I starts to walk again, faster this time, but the feeling of being followed persists. My heart is racing now and I am having trouble catching my breath. I break into a run, but whatever is following me is keeping pace. I can hear heavy footfalls now and something crashing through the underbrush behind me. I am about to be caught. I stumbles and falls to the ground as whatever is chasing me catches up. I looks up to see a large, furry creature standing over me. It is a chimpanzee, and it looks angry. I am terrified as the chimpanzee snatches me up in its powerful arms and begins to drag me deeper into the Forest.
