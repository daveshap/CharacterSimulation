==========

I'm sitting on the ground, leaning against the Eifel Tower. I'm surrounded by a group of children who are playing and laughing. I'm smiling and watching the children, but I look a bit tired. The sun is beginning to set and the sky is turning a beautiful orange color. The air is cooling down and I pull my jacket closer around me. I continue to watch the children as they play and have fun. After a while, the children start to get tired and they come to sit with me. We all lean against the Eifel Tower and look up at the sky. The stars are beginning to come out and the children point and make wishes. I look at the children and feel happy that I get to spend my time with them.
