As soon as I got home from my shift at the grocery store, I was famished. I went to the fridge and grabbed a left over sandwich from the day before, then headed to my bedroom to eat. I turned on the TV and sat down on my bed to eat and watch my favorite soap opera. I was half way through my sandwich when I started to feel drowsy. I turned off the TV and laid down, sandwich in hand, and promptly fell asleep.
