Gabbi can see Mia sitting on a bench, waiting for her. She quickens her pace, eager to chat with her friend. As she gets closer, she sees that Mia has someone with her. Gabbi slows down, not sure if she should intrude. Mia sees her and calls out, "Gabbi! Come meet my new boyfriend, Luke." Gabbi smiles and approaches the bench. "Nice to meet you, Luke."

The sun is setting over the city as I push a stroller down the sidewalk. I'm on my way to the park to meet my friend, Mia. The streets are busy with people heading home from work or out to dinner. I wave to a few familiar faces as I pass by. The park is lit up by the last of the day's sunlight. I can see Mia sitting on a bench, waiting for me. I quicken my pace, eager to chat with her. As I get closer, I see that Mia has someone with her. I slow down, not sure if I should intrude. Mia sees me and calls out, "Gabbi! Come meet my new boyfriend, Luke." I smile and approach the bench. "Nice to meet you, Luke." Luke stands up and shakes my hand. "Likewise. Mia has told me so much about you." I laugh. "I hope she's been saying good things." Mia linked her arm through Luke's. "Of course I have. Gabbi is the best babysitter in the city." I blush with pleasure. "Well, I better get going. It was nice meeting you, Luke." "You too, Gabbi. Maybe we'll see you around sometime." I wave goodbye as I continue on my way. I'm happy to see her friend so happy, but I can't help feeling a little jealous.
