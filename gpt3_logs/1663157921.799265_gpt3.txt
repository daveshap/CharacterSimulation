Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Wang is driving his delivery truck across the craggy surface of the moon. The early morning sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a long shadow behind the truck. Wang is making his final delivery of the day, a load of construction supplies bound for a lunar base on the far side of the moon. He is tired from the long night of driving, but he knows that he only has a few more minutes to go. He crests a small hill and sees the base in the distance. He presses down on the accelerator and the truck lurches forward. Wang arrives at the base and pulls up to the loading dock. He hops out of the truck and begins unloading the supplies. He works quickly, knowing that he wants to get back to his truck and head home before the sun gets too high in the sky. Within a few minutes, he has finished unloading the supplies and is back in his truck, heading home. He drives across the lunar landscape, the only sound the hum of the truck's engine. He looks up at the sky and sees the Earth, a bright blue-and-white ball hanging in the blackness. He thinks about his family back home and how he can't wait to see them again. He knows that it will be a long time before he's able to return to Earth, but he's happy to be able to work and live on the moon.

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I'm Wang, and I'm driving my delivery truck across the craggy surface of the moon. The early morning sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a long shadow behind the truck. I'm making my final delivery of the day, a load of construction supplies bound for a lunar base on the far side of the moon. I'm tired from the long night of driving, but I know that I only have a few more minutes to go. I crest a small hill and see the base in the distance. I press down on the accelerator and the truck lurches forward. I arrive at the base and pull up to the loading dock. I hop out of the truck and begin unloading the supplies. I work quickly, knowing that I want to get back to my truck and head home before the sun gets too high in the sky. Within a few minutes, I have finished unloading the supplies and am back in my truck, heading home. I drive across the lunar landscape, the only sound the hum of the truck's engine. I look up at the sky and see the Earth, a bright blue-and-white ball hanging in the blackness. I think about my family back home and how I can't wait to see them again. I know that it will be a long time before I'm able to return to Earth, but I'm happy to be able to work and live on the moon.
