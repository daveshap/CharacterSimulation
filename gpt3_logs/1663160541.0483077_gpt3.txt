It's a dark, gloomy day in the forest, and I'm taking my lunch break. I'm sitting on a log, eating my sandwich and looking around at the dark trees. There's a feeling of malice in the air, and I can't shake the feeling that something is watching me. Suddenly, I hear a branch snap. I turn around, but there's nothing there. I tell myself it's just my imagination, but I can't help but feel uneasy.
