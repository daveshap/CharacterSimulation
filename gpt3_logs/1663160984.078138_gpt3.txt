REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I'm sitting in my coffee shop, enjoying a cup of coffee and watching the people go by. It's early in the morning, and the sun is just starting to peek over the horizon. The streets are busy with people getting ready for their day. I see a woman walking by, carrying a basket of fruit. She smiles and waves at me, and I return the gesture. Suddenly, I hear a loud noise. I turn around and see a group of men running towards the coffee shop, shouting and brandishing weapons. I know what's happening: they're here to loot and pillage the place. I quickly grab my shotgun and take cover behind the counter. The men burst into the shop, and I open fire. I take down two of them before they can even react. The rest of the men return fire, and I'm forced to duck behind the counter for cover. I hear the sound of shattering glass as the men start to destroy the shop. I know I can't hold them off forever. I grab a Molotov cocktail from under the counter and light it. Then I throw it at the group of men. I hear screams as the men are engulfed in flames. I know I have to get out of here. I grab my shotgun and run out the back door. I hear the sound of the men looting and destroying the shop as I make my escape.
