I'm Mashawn, a construction worker currently working on a project near a quiet beach in Asia. It's a beautiful day out and I'm enjoying the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. I've been working hard all day and I'm ready for a break. I climb down from my work site and head over to the beach for a quick swim. I strip down to my swim trunks and dive into the water. The water is refreshing and I swim around for a few minutes before coming back to the shore. I lie down on the sand and enjoy the warm sun on my skin. I close my eyes and relax for a few minutes before getting up and heading back to work.
