Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Aleksy had always wanted to see the Eifel Tower. It was one of the most iconic structures in the world, and it was right there in his city. So when he got off work from the grocery store late one night, he decided to take a walk over to it. The streets were mostly empty at this time of night, and Aleksy felt a bit nervous as he made his way towards the tower. But as he got closer, he started to feel more excited. And when he finally arrived at the base of the tower, he couldn't help but stare up at it in awe. It was even more impressive up close than he had ever imagined. He stood there for a few minutes, just taking it all in, before he finally decided to head back home. But as he turned to go, he heard a noise coming from one of the alleyways nearby. He hesitated for a moment, not sure whether he should investigate or not. But then he thought, if there's someone in trouble, I should help. So he cautiously made his way towards the alley. As he got closer, he could see that there was a group of men standing there. And they didn't look friendly. He was about to turn and run the other way when one of the men spotted him. "Hey, you! Come here!" Aleksy had no choice but to go towards them. As he got closer, he could see that they were holding someone captive. A young woman was standing there, looking terrified. The men started to jeer and catcall Aleksy as he approached. They were clearly drunk, and he could see that they were about to start harassing the woman. He knew he had to do something. But he was so outnumbered and outmatched. He didn't know how he was going to get them to stop.
