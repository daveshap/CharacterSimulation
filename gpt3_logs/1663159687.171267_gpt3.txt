I jumped up from my chair and ran to the window to see what was going on. I saw a large truck careening off the road and crashing into a tree just a few yards from my cottage. I rushed outside to see if I could help. I found the driver of the truck unconscious and bleeding badly. I quickly went back inside and called for an ambulance. While I was waiting, I did what I could to help the injured driver, using my first aid training to staunch the flow of blood and keep the man comfortable.
