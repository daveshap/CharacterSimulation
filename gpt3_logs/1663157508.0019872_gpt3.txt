REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I was just finishing up my delivery route for the day when I saw a group of people walking along the beach. They were carrying baskets and bags, and I wondered if they were going to set up a stall or something. I was about to drive off when I saw a woman in the group wave to me. I knew her - she was one of my regular customers. I decided to stop and see if she needed help. The woman greeted me and asked me to help carry some of the baskets to her car. I agreed and started to help. I was soon joined by other members of the group, and we all made our way to the woman's car. We loaded up the car and said our goodbyes. I watched as the group drove off, before heading home myself.
