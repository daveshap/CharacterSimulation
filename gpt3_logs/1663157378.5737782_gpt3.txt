I'm using a power drill to drill through a concrete wall. The noise is echoing through the empty building. I'm sweating from the effort of drilling through the wall. I'm wearing a hard hat and a reflector vest. I'm surrounded by piles of rubble and dust. My drill battery is running low, and I'm getting tired. I take a break to rest and wipe the sweat from my brow. I look around at the unfinished office building and wonder how much longer I'll have to work on it.
