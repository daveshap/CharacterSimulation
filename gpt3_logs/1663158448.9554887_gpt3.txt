It's mid-afternoon, and the sun is shining down on the peaceful country cottage. I'm sitting on the porch, enjoying the quiet. I'm surrounded by a beautiful garden, and I can hear the birds chirping in the trees. Suddenly, I hear a car pull up to the cottage. I get up to see who it is, and I see my old friend, John. John is a business owner, and he's come to me for advice. We sit down on the porch, and John tells me about his problem. He's been having a lot of trouble with his employees, and he doesn't know what to do. I listen carefully and offer my advice. After a few minutes, John thanks me and gets back in his car. I watch him drive away, and then I go back to my book.
