He whirls around, heart pounding, to see a large, furry creature standing there, staring at him. It's a jaguar! Mashawn's fear turns to terror as the jaguar starts to stalk toward him.

Then, suddenly, the jaguar releases him and runs off into the forest. Mashawn is bleeding badly, but he's alive. He struggles to his feet and starts to make his way back to civilization. He knows he's lucky to be alive, but he'll never forget the terror of that moment in the dark forest, when he thought he was going to die.

I'm trudging through the dark forest, my construction equipment weighing me down. I've been working all morning, and I'm getting tired. Suddenly, I hear a noise in the distance. I stop and listen, trying to identify the sound. Is it an animal? A person? I can't tell. It's getting closer, whatever it is. I start to feel uneasy. Suddenly, the noise is right behind me. I whirl around, heart pounding, to see a large, furry creature standing there, staring at me. It's a jaguar! My fear turns to terror as the jaguar starts to stalk toward me. There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. I'm going to be killed! The jaguar is upon me now, teeth bared. I shut my eyes, waiting for the end. But it doesn't come. I open my eyes to see the jaguar standing there, looking at me. Then, without warning, the jaguar leaps at me, knocking me to the ground. I feel the jaguar's teeth sink into my flesh and I scream in pain. I struggle to get free, but the jaguar is too strong. I know I'm going to die.
