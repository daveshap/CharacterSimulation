Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Aleksy cautiously enters the forest, clutching a machete in one hand and a flashlight in the other. He'd been warned about this place by the locals - that it was dark, and deadly. And now, as he shone his light around, he could see why. The trees were close together, forming a canopy that blocked out most of the light. The ground was covered in a thick layer of leaves and twigs, making it difficult to see where he was stepping. Every sound he made echoed eerily through the trees. Aleksy had been walking for hours, and he was beginning to get tired and thirsty. He was debating whether to turn back when he heard a noise in the distance. It sounded like... music? He shone his light in the direction of the noise and started walking towards it. As he got closer, he could see a faint light shining through the trees. And then he heard it - laughter. He quickened his pace, and soon he came to a clearing. In the center of the clearing was a small campfire, and around the campfire were five figures, all dressed in strange clothes. They looked up as he approached. "Welcome, Aleksy," one of them said. "We've been expecting you."

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I cautiously enter the forest, clutching a machete in one hand and a flashlight in the other. I'd been warned about this place by the locals - that it was dark, and deadly. And now, as I shine my light around, I can see why. The trees are close together, forming a canopy that blocks out most of the light. The ground is covered in a thick layer of leaves and twigs, making it difficult to see where I am stepping. Every sound I make echoes eerily through the trees. I have been walking for hours, and I am beginning to get tired and thirsty. I am debating whether to turn back when I hear a noise in the distance. It sounded like... music? I shone my light in the direction of the noise and started walking towards it. As I got closer, I could see a faint light shining through the trees. And then I heard it - laughter. I quickened my pace, and soon I came to a clearing. In the center of the clearing was a small campfire, and around the campfire were five figures, all dressed in strange clothes. They looked up as I approached. "Welcome, Aleksy," one of them said. "We've been expecting you."
