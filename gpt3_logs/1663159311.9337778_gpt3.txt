Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Sandy is in her bedroom, lying on the bed. She is wearing a loose fitting tank top and shorts. Her hair is pulled back in a messy bun and she has no makeup on. She looks tired and there are dark circles under her eyes. She is scrolling through her phone, mindlessly scrolling through social media. She comes across a post from a friend that shows her friend's happy family on vacation. Sandy's mood immediately changes and she feels a pang of jealousy. She puts her phone down and looks around her bedroom. It is a typical suburban bedroom with beige walls and a dresser with a mirror. There is a clothes hamper in the corner and a door that leads to a small bathroom. Sandy feels like she is trapped in this room. She gets up from the bed and goes to the window. She looks out the window and sees her neighbor's children playing in the yard. She watches them for a few minutes and then turns away from the window, her heart heavy with sadness.

I'm lying on my bed, scrolling through my phone. I come across a post from a friend that shows her happy family on vacation. I immediately feel a pang of jealousy. I put my phone down and look around my bedroom. It's a typical suburban bedroom with beige walls and a dresser with a mirror. There's a clothes hamper in the corner and a door that leads to a small bathroom. I feel like I'm trapped in this room. I get up from the bed and go to the window. I look out the window and see my neighbor's children playing in the yard. I watch them for a few minutes and then turn away from the window, my heart heavy with sadness.
