I walk to the window and gaze out at the city skyline, admiring the way the light reflects off the glass and metal of the buildings. As I look out, I see the city begin to light up as the evening sets in. I watch the cars driving by and the people walking on the sidewalks below and wonder what everyone is doing and where they're going. I eventually turn away from the window and begin to get ready for bed, starting with brushing my teeth and washing my face. I then change into my pajamas and crawl into bed, pulling the covers up to my chin. As I lie there, I begin to think about my day and what I've accomplished. I reflect on my job and how I've helped create software that people all over the world use. I feel proud of my work and grateful for my career. Eventually, I begin to feel tired and my thoughts start to drift. I begin to think about the future and what it might hold for me. I wonder if I'll find love, have children, and continue to be successful in my career. As I start to drift off to sleep, I feel happy and content with my life.
