I finally get a break at 6pm, and I'm eager to relax in my bedroom. I kick off my shoes and floop down onto my bed, taking a deep breath. Ah, it feels good to be home. I stretch my arms and legs, letting my muscles loosen up. I close my eyes and let my mind wander, taking a much-needed break from work.
