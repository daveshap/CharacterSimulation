Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Gabbi just arrived at the babysitting gig. She walks up the path to the porch, where she can see the family's cat sitting in the rocking chair. Gabbi is a bit surprised to see the cat, but she knows that the family is away on vacation and she's just here to take care of their house and pets. Gabbi walks up to the door and unlocks it. She steps inside and immediately feels something wrong. The house is eerily quiet and the only sound is the ticking of a clock. Gabbi starts to feel a bit scared, but she tells herself that there's nothing to be afraid of. She walks into the living room and sees that the TV is on. That's strange, she thinks. Usually, when people go on vacation, they turn off all the lights and appliances. Gabbi walks over to the TV and turns it off. As she's about to leave the living room, she hears a noise coming from upstairs. It sounds like someone is crying. Gabbi is really scared now, but she knows she has to investigate. She slowly walks up the stairs, trying not to make any noise. When she gets to the top of the stairs, she sees a girl standing in the hallway, crying. Gabbi asks the girl what's wrong. The girl says that she's scared and she doesn't want to be alone. Gabbi assures the girl that she's not alone and that she will stay with her until morning. The girl stops crying and Gabbi leads her into one of the bedrooms. She helps the girl into bed and tucks her in. Gabbi then sits in a chair next to the bed and stays with the girl until she falls asleep.

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I walk up to the babysitting gig and see the family's cat sitting in the rocking chair. I'm a bit surprised to see the cat, but I know that the family is away on vacation and I'm just here to take care of their house and pets. I walk up to the door and unlock it. I step inside and immediately feel something wrong. The house is eerily quiet and the only sound is the ticking of a clock. I start to feel a bit scared, but I tell myself that there's nothing to be afraid of. I walk into the living room and see that the TV is on. That's strange, I think. Usually, when people go on vacation, they turn off all the lights and appliances. I walk over to the TV and turn it off. As I'm about to leave the living room, I hear a noise coming from upstairs. It sounds like someone is crying. I'm really scared now, but I know I have to investigate. I slowly walk up the stairs, trying not to make any noise. When I get to the top of the stairs, I see a girl standing in the hallway, crying. I ask the girl what's wrong. The girl says that she's scared and she doesn't want to be alone. I assure the girl that she's not alone and that I will stay with her until morning. The girl stops crying and I lead her into one of the bedrooms. I help the girl into bed and tuck her in. I then sit in a chair next to the bed and stay with the girl until she falls asleep.
