SCENE: Wang is standing on the beach, watching the sun set. He's wearing a delivery uniform and holding a package. He looks around, taking in the quiet beauty of the scene. He feels a sense of peace here, away from the noise and bustle of the city. He remembers the first time he came to this beach. He had just started working as a delivery driver, and he was exhausted from the long hours. He had taken a wrong turn and ended up here, and he had fallen asleep on the sand. When he woke up, he was amazed by the view. He's been coming back ever since. Wang gazes at the horizon, admiring the colors of the sky. He takes a deep breath of the salty air and feels his muscles relax. This is his favorite time of day.
