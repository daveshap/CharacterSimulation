Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: The soft light of the morning sun filtered through the leaves of the trees, casting a dappled pattern on the ground below. Swathi sat on a bench, her laptop open on her lap, absently scrolling through her Facebook feed as she waited for her train to arrive. She was wearing her usual work clothes - a well-pressed shirt and trousers - but she had foregone her usual heels in favor of a pair of comfortable flats. She had a cup of coffee in one hand and a croissant in the other, and she took occasional sips and bites as she scanned the screen. The sound of footsteps on the pavement interrupted her reverie, and she looked up to see a group of tourists approaching. They were chattering in a mix of French and English, and they stopped just in front of her, blocking her view of the tracks. Swathi sighed and took another sip of coffee, trying to tune out their conversation. Suddenly, the ground shook beneath her feet and she heard a loud rumble. Her heart leapt into her throat and she dropped her coffee cup, spilling the hot liquid onto her lap. The tourists screamed and ran in all directions, and Swathi quickly gathered her things and stood up. The Eifel Tower was crumbling before her eyes, pieces of metal and stone raining down onto the ground. Swathi stood frozen in shock, her eyes wide as she watched the destruction. Suddenly, a large piece of debris came hurtling towards her and she instinctively threw up her arms to protect her head. She felt a sharp pain as the debris hit her, and then everything went black.

The soft light of the morning sun filtered through the leaves of the trees, casting a dappled pattern on the ground below. I sat on a bench, my laptop open on my lap, absently scrolling through my Facebook feed as I waited for my train to arrive. I was wearing my usual work clothes - a well-pressed shirt and trousers - but I had foregone my usual heels in favor of a pair of comfortable flats. I had a cup of coffee in one hand and a croissant in the other, and I took occasional sips and bites as I scanned the screen. The sound of footsteps on the pavement interrupted my reverie, and I looked up to see a group of tourists approaching. They were chattering in a mix of French and English, and they stopped just in front of me, blocking my view of the tracks. I sighed and took another sip of coffee, trying to tune out their conversation. Suddenly, the ground shook beneath my feet and I heard a loud rumble. My heart leapt into my throat and I dropped my coffee cup, spilling the hot liquid onto my lap. The tourists screamed and ran in all directions, and I quickly gathered my things and stood up.
