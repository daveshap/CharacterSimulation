==========

I'm working on my latest project in the middle of the night on the moon. I'm a software engineer, and I've been working on this project for weeks. But I'm finally getting close to finishing it. I type away at my computer, my fingers flying over the keyboard. I'm so focused on my work that I don't hear the approaching footsteps until they're right behind me. I turn around to see who it is, and my heart sinks when I see my boss. He's not happy. He starts to yell at me, demanding to know why I'm still working on this project. I try to explain that I'm close to finishing, but my boss doesn't want to hear it. He's already made up his mind. He tells me that I've been working on this project for too long, and that I'm going to have to hand it over to someone else. I'm heartbroken. I've worked so hard on this project, and I was so close to finishing it. But I know that my boss is right. I've been working on it for too long, and I need to let someone else take over. I hand over the project to my boss and watch as he walks away with it. I know that I've done my best, but I can't help feeling like I've failed.
