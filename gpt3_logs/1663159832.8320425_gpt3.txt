I've been making the same rounds delivering packages to the rural country cottage for years, and I know all the residents by name. They all seem to be good, honest folk, just trying to make an honest living. As I approach the cottage, I see a light on in the window and know that someone is home. I deliver the package to the door and am about to head back to my truck when I hear a loud crash from inside the cottage. I hesitate for a moment, unsure of what to do. I don't want to get involved, but I can't just leave if there's something wrong. I decide to knock on the door and see if everything is alright. When there's no answer, I try the door handle and find that it's unlocked. I slowly enter the cottage, calling out the resident's name. When there's no response, I begin to worry that something bad has happened. I cautiously make my way through the cottage, checking each room for the resident. I finally find them in the kitchen, lying on the floor unconscious. I immediately rush to their side and check for a pulse. When I find one, I let out a sigh of relief. I know I need to get help, and fast. I grab a nearby phone and dial 911, requesting an ambulance. I stay on the line with the operator until help arrives, and then I give a statement to the police. I am thankful that I was able to help, and am glad that the resident is going to be okay.
