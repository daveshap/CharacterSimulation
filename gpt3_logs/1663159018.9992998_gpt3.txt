==========

I was working the graveyard shift at the local grocery store when the alarm system went off. I knew that this meant that someone had broken into the store, so I quickly grabbed a broom and started trying to defend myself. The intruder was a big, burly man, and he quickly overpowers me. He ties me up and starts ransacking the store. I'm terrified, and I think that the man is going to kill me. The man doesn't kill me, but he does rough me up pretty badly. He leaves me tied up in a corner of the store and makes off with a bunch of merchandise. I'm relieved to be alive but traumatized by the experience.
