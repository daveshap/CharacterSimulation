==========

I'm sitting in an office chair at a desk, with my backpack on the floor next to me. I look around the room, taking in the shelves of books and the framed posters on the walls. I swallow hard, feeling a bit nervous. A man walks into the room and I stand up, facing him. He extends his hand and I shake it, introducing myself. He tells me to have a seat and I do so, perching on the edge of the chair. He asks me why I'm interested in the job and I start to list off my qualifications. I talk about my experience with customer service and my love of working with people. The man nods along, seeming impressed. He asks me a few more questions and then tells me he'll be in touch. I thank him and stand up, shaking his hand again. I gather my things and walk out of the room, feeling hopeful.
