Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Swathi walks down the street, her mind racing with coding problems she's been trying to solve all day. She's eager to get home and relax, but first she has to stop at the grocery store. The city is alive with energy and Swathi feels a familiar thrill as she steps into the familiar hustle and bustle. She weaves her way through the crowd, dodging people and bags as she makes her way to the store. Inside, she grabs a basket and starts down the aisle, her mind still on her work. She absently throws items into her basket, not really paying attention to what she's doing. She's so lost in thought that she doesn't even notice when she bumps into someone. "Sorry!" she exclaims, finally snapping out of her thoughts. She looks up to see a handsome stranger standing there, a slight smile on his face. For a moment, they just stand there, looking at each other. Then, with a small nod, the stranger moves on and Swathi does the same. She finishes her shopping in a daze, her mind still racing.

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I walk down the street, my mind racing with coding problems I've been trying to solve all day. I'm eager to get home and relax, but first I have to stop at the grocery store. The city is alive with energy and I feel a familiar thrill as I step into the familiar hustle and bustle. I weave my way through the crowd, dodging people and bags as I make my way to the store. Inside, I grab a basket and start down the aisle, my mind still on my work. I absently throw items into my basket, not really paying attention to what I'm doing. I'm so lost in thought that I don't even notice when I bump into someone. "Sorry!" I exclaim, finally snapping out of my thoughts. I look up to see a handsome stranger standing there, a slight smile on his face. For a moment, we just stand there, looking at each other. Then, with a small nod, the stranger moves on and I do the same. I finish my shopping in a daze, my mind still racing.
