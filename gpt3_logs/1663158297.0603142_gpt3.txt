==========

I sit on the mountaintop, watching the sun set over the picturesque European landscape. I've been here many times before, but it never fails to take my breath away. As the last rays of sunlight disappear, my thoughts turn to my children, who are at home with their father. I miss them terribly, but I know that I made the right decision when I decided to stay home and take care of them. I know that my children are in good hands, and I'm confident that they'll be just fine without me.
