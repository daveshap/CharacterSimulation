As the sun sets over the horizon, I can't help but marvel at the beautiful orange hue in the sky. I'm sitting on the porch of my country cottage, watching the colours change as the sun begins to dip below the tree line. I feel a sense of peace and calm wash over me as I take in the serene scene before me. The birds are singing in the trees and the breeze is gently rustling the leaves. All is right in the world.
