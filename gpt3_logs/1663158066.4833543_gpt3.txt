Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: The air is still and dusty, the only sound that of Sandy's own breathing in her space suit. She slowly makes her way across the lunar landscape, her bulky suit and oversized backpack making it difficult to move gracefully. In the distance, she can see the Earth, a bright and beautiful blue-green sphere hanging in the inky blackness of space. Sandy is on a nature walk, something she likes to do in her free time. She enjoys the peace and solitude of being on the moon, away from the hustle and bustle of daily life back on Earth. As she walks, she looks for interesting rocks and craters to explore. Tonight, Sandy has a special treat in store: she's going to watch the Earth rise. She knows that from her vantage point on the moon, she'll be able to see the Earth slowly crawl up over the horizon, a beautiful sight that never fails to fill her with wonder. She finds a good spot to set up her tripod and camera, and settles down to wait. As she watches, the Earth slowly rises, the blue-green of the oceans and continents coming into view. The sight is breathtaking, and Sandy can't help but feeling a sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of our planet.
