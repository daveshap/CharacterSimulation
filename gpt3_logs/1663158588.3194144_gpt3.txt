Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Swathi is standing on the surface of the moon, surrounded by an eerily quiet landscape. She looks up at the sky, where the Earth is visible as a small blue-and-white sphere. Swathi feels a sense of awe and wonder at the sight. Suddenly, she hears a noise behind her and turns to see a human-like figure clad in a shining silver suit walking towards her. The figure comes to a stop in front of her and regards her with a calm, benevolent expression. Swathi is completely shocked by the sight. She has no idea who or what this figure is. The figure speaks to her in a gentle voice, asking her name and what she is doing on the moon. Swathi stammers out a reply, telling the figure her name and that she is a software engineer. The figure nods, as if this is all very interesting. The figure introduces itself as an alien from a planet called Zeta Reticuli, and says that it has been observing humans for many years. The alien goes on to say that it is impressed with the progress humans have made, despite their wars and conflicts. It says that it has decided to help humans by giving them some of its advanced technology. Swathi is completely amazed by all of this. She thanks the alien for its kindness and promises to use the technology to help make the world a better place. The alien nods in approval and then slowly fades away, leaving Swathi alone on the moon with her new-found treasure.
