REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I'm Swathi, a software engineer who works from home. It's mid-afternoon and I'm just finishing up my work for the day. I've been sitting at my desk, staring at my computer screen for the past few hours, and I'm starting to feel a bit drained. I get up from my desk and stretch my arms above my head. I let out a long sigh and rub my tired eyes. As I do, I notice a few things around my bedroom that I haven't noticed before. The cobwebs in the corner of the room, the dust on the dresser, the pile of clothes on the floor... I've been so busy with work lately that I've let my own personal space become a bit of a mess. I decide to take a break from work and tidy up my bedroom. I start by making my bed, then I pick up the clothes off the floor and put them away. I dust off the dresser and the windowsill, and sweep the floor. After a few minutes of work, my bedroom looks much better. I feel better too. I'm not as tired as I was before, and I've taken a small step towards taking better care of myself.
