I'm sitting in my office cubicle, munching on a sandwich and browsing the internet. I'm surrounded by the low hum of conversations and the sound of keyboard typing; my coworkers are all busy working away on their own projects. My eyes wander to the clock on my computer screen; I still have another hour left before I can take my lunch break. I take a sip of my soda and go back to browsing the internet.
