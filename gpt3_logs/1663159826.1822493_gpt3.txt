Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Jenna is walking down the street after school, her backpack slung over one shoulder. The city bustles around her, the sidewalks crowded with people hurrying to get home from work or running errands. The air is alive with the sound of car horns honking and brakes squealing. The buildings around Jenna are tall and close together, their windows reflecting the light of the setting sun. As Jenna walks, she glances up at the windows of the buildings around her, her eyes drawn to the bright lights and movement inside. She sees people sitting at desks, talking on the phone or typing on computers. She sees families gathered around tables, eating dinner together. She even sees a group of kids her own age playing a video game in one of the apartments. Jenna feels a pang of envy as she watches the group of kids. She wishes she could be hanging out with her friends too, but she has to get home to help her mom with dinner. With a sigh, Jenna turns away from the window and continues on her way.

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I'm walking down the street after school, my backpack slung over one shoulder. The city bustles around me, the sidewalks crowded with people hurrying to get home from work or running errands. The air is alive with the sound of car horns honking and brakes squealing. The buildings around me are tall and close together, their windows reflecting the light of the setting sun. As I walk, I glance up at the windows of the buildings around me, my eyes drawn to the bright lights and movement inside. I see people sitting at desks, talking on the phone or typing on computers. I see families gathered around tables, eating dinner together. I even see a group of kids my own age playing a video game in one of the apartments. I feel a pang of envy as I watch the group of kids. I wish I could be hanging out with my friends too, but I have to get home to help my mom with dinner. With a sigh, I turn away from the window and continue on my way.
