Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: The sun was just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a soft pink and orange glow across the landscape. Jenna woke up slowly, yawning and stretching as she sat up in her sleeping bag. She rubbed her eyes sleepily, taking in her surroundings. She was camping in the middle of nowhere in Africa, and the silence was deafening. Jenna got up and grabbed her water bottle, taking a long drink before rummaging through her backpack for some breakfast. She munched on a granola bar as she stared out at the vastness of the plains before her. She couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the natural beauty of her surroundings. Suddenly, Jenna heard a loud noise coming from the other side of the camp. She grabbed her camera and started to creep towards the sound, curiosity getting the better of her. She peeked around a tree to see a group of elephants, trumpeting and shuffling around in the mud. Jenna snapped a few pictures before cautiously approaching the animals. She was absolutely fascinated by them. She watched them for a while, before finally packing up her things and heading back on the long journey home. She knew she would never forget this incredible experience.

The sun was just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a soft pink and orange glow across the landscape. I woke up slowly, yawning and stretching as I sat up in my sleeping bag. I rubbed my eyes sleepily, taking in my surroundings. I was camping in the middle of nowhere in Africa, and the silence was deafening. I got up and grabbed my water bottle, taking a long drink before rummaging through my backpack for some breakfast. I munched on a granola bar as I stared out at the vastness of the plains before me. I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the natural beauty of my surroundings. Suddenly, I heard a loud noise coming from the other side of the camp. I grabbed my camera and started to creep towards the sound, curiosity getting the better of me. I peeked around a tree to see a group of elephants, trumpeting and shuffling around in the mud. I snapped a few pictures before cautiously approaching the animals. I was absolutely fascinated by them. I watched them for a while, before finally packing up my things and heading back on the long journey home. I knew I would never forget this incredible experience.
