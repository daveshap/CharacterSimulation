SCENE: The sun is setting over the savannah as Swathi, a software engineer, watches the animals grazing on the grass. She's on a safari trip with her family and they're staying in a lodge in the middle of nowhere. The only sound is the chatter of the animals and the wind blowing through the trees. Swathi is entranced by the scene before her and the peace she feels. She's been wanting to take a trip like this for years and she's finally here. She can't believe she's actually in Africa. The next morning, Swathi wakes early and goes for a walk. She sees impalas, gazelles, and even a lioness stalking her prey. She's careful to stay out of the way and not disturb the animals. She knows this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and she doesn't want to miss a thing.

==========

I can't believe I'm actually in Africa. I've been wanting to take a trip like this for years, and I'm finally here. The sun is setting over the savannah, and I'm watching the animals graze on the grass. I'm entranced by the scene before me and the peace I feel. I know this is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I don't want to miss a thing. The next morning, I wake early and go for a walk. I see impalas, gazelles, and even a lioness stalking her prey. I'm careful to stay out of the way and not disturb the animals. This is an amazing experience, and I'm so glad I'm here to enjoy it.
