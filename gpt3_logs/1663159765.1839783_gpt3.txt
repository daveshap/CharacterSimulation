Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: The sun is setting over the peaceful country cottage, and Mashawn is getting ready to call it a day. He's been working hard all day, and he's looking forward to relaxing in his cozy little home. He enters the cottage and kicks off his boots, then hangs his jacket on the hooks by the door. He strolls into the living room, where the fire is crackling in the fireplace. He sinks down into his comfortable armchair and lets out a sigh of contentment. This is his favorite time of day, when he can relax and enjoy the quiet of the countryside. He'll have a simple dinner of bread and cheese, and then he'll retire to bed, ready to face another day tomorrow.

The sun is setting, and I'm getting ready to call it a day. I've been working hard all day, and I'm looking forward to relaxing in my cozy little home. I enter the cottage and kick off my boots, then hang my jacket on the hooks by the door. I stroll into the living room, where the fire is crackling in the fireplace. I sink down into my comfortable armchair and let out a sigh of contentment. This is my favorite time of day, when I can relax and enjoy the quiet of the countryside. I'll have a simple dinner of bread and cheese, and then I'll retire to bed, ready to face another day tomorrow.
