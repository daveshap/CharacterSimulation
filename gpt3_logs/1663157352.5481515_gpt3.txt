REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I was sitting on the beach, enjoying the quiet evening. The sun was just starting to set, and the air was still warm. I was watching the waves crash against the shore and thinking about my life. I'd been working at the grocery store for years, and I was starting to feel like I was in a rut. I'd never traveled or done anything exciting, and I was starting to wonder if there was more to life than just working and paying bills. My thoughts were interrupted by the sound of someone approaching. I turned to see a woman walking towards me. She was carrying a picnic basket, and she had a wide smile on her face. The woman introduced herself as Maria, and she told me that she'd been watching me from her house nearby. She said that she could tell that I was a good person, and she wanted to be my friend. I was hesitant at first, but I eventually agreed to spend some time with Maria. We sat down on the beach and started talking. Maria told me about her life and her travels. She'd been all over the world, and she'd had some amazing experiences. I listened with envy, but I also felt happy just to be talking to someone who had done something with their life. As the sun set, Maria and I watched the stars come out. We talked about our dreams and what we wanted to do with our lives. I told Maria that I'd always wanted to travel, and Maria offered to take me on a trip around the world. I was hesitant at first, but I eventually agreed. And so, my adventure began.
