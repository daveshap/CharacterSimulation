Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: It was lunch time, and Tom was taking a break from his bartending duties to explore the dark forest near his South American village. He had been warned by the elders not to venture into the forest alone, but he was feeling adventurous today and decided to take his chances. As he walked deeper into the woods, the light began to fade and the trees became thicker and more menacing. Suddenly, he heard a noise in the distance and froze in his tracks. Was it a animal? Or something more sinister? He crept forward cautiously, his heart racing, and peered around a tree to see what was making the noise. To his shock, he saw a massive, furry creature standing over a dead body, gnawing hungrily on the bones. The creature looked up and locked eyes with Tom, and for a moment, time seemed to stand still. Then, with a guttural snarl, the creature charged towards him. Tom turned and sprinted back the way he had come, terror coursing through his veins. He could hear the creature's footsteps pounding the ground behind him, getting closer and closer. Just as it was about to catch him, he tripped over a tree root and went sprawling to the ground. The creature was upon him in an instant, its drooling jaws opening wide to devour him. But before it could take a bite, Tom felt something sharp pierce his neck and everything went black.

It was lunch time, and I was taking a break from my bartending duties to explore the dark forest near my South American village. I had been warned by the elders not to venture into the Forest alone, but I was feeling adventurous today and decided to take my chances. As I walked deeper into the woods, the light began to fade and the trees became thicker and more menacing. Suddenly, I heard a noise in the distance and froze in my tracks. Was it a animal? Or something more sinister? I crept forward cautiously, my heart racing, and peered around a tree to see what was making the noise. To my shock, I saw a massive, furry creature standing over a dead body, gnawing hungrily on the bones. The creature looked up and locked eyes with me, and for a moment, time seemed to stand still. Then, with a guttural snarl, the creature charged towards me. I turned and sprinted back the way I had come, terror coursing through my veins. I could hear the creature's footsteps pounding the ground behind me, getting closer and closer. Just as it was about to catch me, I tripped over a tree root and went sprawling to the ground. The creature was upon me in an instant, its drooling jaws opening wide to devour me. But before it could take a bite, I felt something sharp pierce my neck and everything went black.
