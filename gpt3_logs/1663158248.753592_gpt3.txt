Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: The sun is setting over the African plains, and Aleksy is getting ready to close up the grocery store for the night. He's been working all day, and he's exhausted. He's just about to lock the doors when he hears a loud noise outside. It sounds like someone is running towards the store. Aleksy unlocks the door and sees a man running towards him, followed by a pack of lions. The man is terrified and Aleksy knows he won't be able to outrun the lions. He's about to close the door and lock the man out when he sees the fear in the man's eyes. He can't just leave him to die. Aleksy yells for the man to come inside and runs to the back of the store to get a can of pepper spray. He's not sure if it will work on lions, but it's all he has. He sprays the lions as they come through the door and they start to back away. The man is safe, at least for now. Aleksy knows the lions will be back, so he locks the doors and prepares to defend the store all night.

==========

I was just about to lock up the store for the night when I heard a loud noise outside. It sounded like someone was running towards the store. I unlocked the door and saw a man running towards me, followed by a pack of lions. The man was terrified and I knew he wouldn't be able to outrun the lions. I was about to close the door and lock the man out when I saw the fear in his eyes. I couldn't just leave him to die. I yelled for the man to come inside and ran to the back of the store to get a can of pepper spray. I wasn't sure if it would work on lions, but it was all I had. I sprayed the lions as they came through the door and they started to back away. The man was safe, at least for now. I knew the lions would be back, so I locked the doors and prepared to defend the store all night.
