REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I'm huddled under the Eifel Tower, trying to stay warm. I've been here for hours, ever since I ran away from home. I'm not sure what I'm going to do next, but I know I can't go back. I hear footsteps approaching, and I tense up, ready to run. But then I recognize the figure as my friend, Alex. "What are you doing here?" Alex asks. "I ran away," I say. "I can't go back home." "Come on," Alex says. "Let's go somewhere warm. I know a place." I hesitate for a moment, but then I nod and follow Alex away from the Eifel Tower and into the night.
