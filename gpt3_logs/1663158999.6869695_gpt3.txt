Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Mashawn is sitting on the edge of a crater, his feet dangling over the edge. He's been working all day, and he's exhausted. The only sound is the faint buzz of his oxygen tank. He looks up at the stars, wondering if anyone is up there looking back at him. He thinks about his family back on Earth. He misses them, but he knows that he's doing important work. He's helping to build a new colony on the moon, and one day his children will be able to live here too. Suddenly, Mashawn hears a noise. He looks around, but he can't see anything. He gets to his feet, heart pounding, and starts to walk back to the safety of the colony. But whatever was making the noise is following him. He quickens his pace, but whatever it is is gaining on him. He turns to run, but before he can take more than a few steps, something grabs him from behind and drags him into the darkness...
