REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I was walking on the moon, early in the morning. I was wearing a spacesuit and carrying a backpack full of supplies. I'd been exploring the moon for hours, and I was getting tired. Suddenly, I saw something in the distance. It looked like a structure of some kind. I walked towards it, and as I got closer, I realized that it was a spaceship. I'd never seen anything like it before. I walked up to the ship and looked at it. It was huge, and it looked very advanced. I couldn't believe that I'd found something like this on the moon. I spent a few minutes exploring the ship, and then I headed back to my base camp.
