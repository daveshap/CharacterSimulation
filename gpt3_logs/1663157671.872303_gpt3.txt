Wang keeps his hand on the steering wheel, his eyes scanning the road ahead. He's getting close to his destination, but he doesn't let his guard down. Suddenly, he sees movement in the bushes by the side of the road. He slows down, his heart racing. He knows he shouldn't stop, but he can't just leave someone stranded in the middle of the night.

==========

I'm driving my truck through the darkness, my headlights cutting through the night. I'm delivering a shipment of supplies to a remote village in Africa, and I know I have to be careful. There are often bandits on these roads, looking to steal whatever they can. I keep my hand on the steering wheel, my eyes scanning the road ahead. I'm getting close to my destination, but I don't let my guard down. Suddenly, I see movement in the bushes by the side of the road. I slow down, my heart racing. I know I shouldn't stop, but I can't just leave someone stranded in the middle of the night. I hesitate for a moment, then decide to stop. I cautiously get out of the truck, my hand on my gun. I approach the bushes, and a man jumps out at me, brandishing a knife. I jump back, my heart pounding. I draw my gun and fire, hitting the man in the chest. The man falls to the ground, dead. I stand there for a moment, my hand shaking. I know I had no choice, but killing someone is never easy. I take a deep breath and get back in the truck, driving the rest of the way to my destination.
