==========

I was sitting at my desk, munching on a sandwich and reading something on my laptop, when my phone rang. "Hey, what's up?" I said into the phone. I listened for a moment, then my face broke into a smile. "That's great news! I'll be right there." I hung up the phone and started to get up from my desk, but my cat wound itself around my legs, meowing for attention. I stooped down to give the cat a quick pat, then hurried out of the room.
