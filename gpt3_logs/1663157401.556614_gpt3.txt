Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: The sun is just peeking over the horizon as Bob opens up his coffee shop. He's got a big day ahead, as he's catering the breakfast shift for a big concert happening in the park across the street. He's been up for hours already, getting everything ready, and he knows he won't have a chance to sit down until it's all over. He can hear the music already, even though the concert won't start for another few hours. The park is already starting to fill up with people, and he knows it's going to be a long day. But he's happy to be a part of it, and he knows his coffee will help keep everyone going. He's just getting everything set up when he hears a shout from outside. He knows that voice - it's his old friend, Joe. Joe is one of the security guards for the concert, and he's come to get Bob's help. Apparently, there's been a mix-up with the catering order, and they're short a lot of coffee. Bob quickly grabs a bunch of his coffee beans and starts grinding them, getting ready to make a massive pot of coffee. He knows it's going to be a long day, but he's happy to help out his friends. And he knows that, at the end of it all, there will be a great concert to enjoy.

==========

I can see the sun just peeking over the horizon as I open up my coffee shop. I've got a big day ahead, as I'm catering the breakfast shift for a big concert happening in the park across the street. I've been up for hours already, getting everything ready, and I know I won't have a chance to sit down until it's all over. I can hear the music already, even though the concert won't start for another few hours. The park is already starting to fill up with people, and I know it's going to be a long day. But I'm happy to be a part of it, and I know my coffee will help keep everyone going. I'm just getting everything set up when I hear a shout from outside. I know that voice - it's my old friend, Joe. Joe is one of the security guards for the concert, and he's come to get my help. Apparently, there's been a mix-up with the catering order, and they're short a lot of coffee. I quickly grab a bunch of my coffee beans and start grinding them, getting ready to make a massive pot of coffee. I know it's going to be a long day, but I'm happy to help out my friends. And I know that, at the end of it all, there will be a great concert to enjoy.
