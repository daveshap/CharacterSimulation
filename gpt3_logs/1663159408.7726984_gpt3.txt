Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Jenna is sitting in her office chair, staring at her computer screen with a look of concentration. She is typing away at the keyboard, her fingers moving nimbly over the keys. Every few moments, she pauses to think, biting her lip in concentration. She has been working on this project for hours, and she is determined to get it right. The office is quiet, save for the sound of Jenna's typing. The only light comes from the computer screen, casting a ghostly glow over Jenna's face. The rest of the room is shrouded in darkness. Jenna's eyes are beginning to sting from staring at the screen for so long, but she doesn't want to take a break. She knows she is getting close to finishing the project, and she doesn't want to lose her momentum. Suddenly, Jenna's concentration is broken by a noise from outside the office. She hears footsteps in the hallway, and then a voice calling her name. Jenna's heart sinks. She knows she should have locked the door. She tries to think of a way to stall for time, but before she can say anything, the person outside the office opens the door and walks in.

==========

I'm sitting in my office chair, staring at my computer screen with a look of concentration. I'm typing away at the keyboard, my fingers moving nimbly over the keys. Every few moments, I pause to think, biting my lip in concentration. I've been working on this project for hours, and I'm determined to get it right. The office is quiet, save for the sound of my typing. The only light comes from the computer screen, casting a ghostly glow over my face. The rest of the room is shrouded in darkness. My eyes are beginning to sting from staring at the screen for so long, but I don't want to take a break. I know I'm getting close to finishing the project, and I don't want to lose my momentum. Suddenly, my concentration is broken by a noise from outside the office. I hear footsteps in the hallway, and then a voice calling my name. My heart sinks. I know I should have locked the door. I try to think of a way to stall for time, but before I can say anything, the person outside the office opens the door and walks in.
