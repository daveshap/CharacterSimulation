Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Aleksy stands on the mountaintop, his breath coming in short gasps in the cold night air. He looks around, taking in the view of the distant valley below, the sparkling lights of the town in the distance. A feeling of peace and contentment fills him. He turns and begins to walk back down the mountain path, his feet sinking into the soft, powdery snow. He knows he should be getting back home, but he can't help but pause to take in the beauty of the night around him. Suddenly, he hears a noise behind him and turns to see a large, shaggy creature standing just a few feet away, watching him with bright, intelligent eyes. Aleksy's heart quickens in fear, but he holds his ground, knowing that he's not doing anything wrong. The creature takes a step forward, and Aleksy takes a step back. They stand there for a moment, staring at each other, before the creature finally turns and lopes off into the darkness. Aleksy watches it go, his heart still pounding in his chest, before he finally turns and continues on his way down the mountain.

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I stand on the mountaintop, my breath coming in short gasps in the cold night air. I look around, taking in the view of the distant valley below, the sparkling lights of the town in the distance. A feeling of peace and contentment fills me. I turn and begin to walk back down the mountain path, my feet sinking into the soft, powdery snow. I know I should be getting back home, but I can't help but pause to take in the beauty of the night around me. Suddenly, I hear a noise behind me and turn to see a large, shaggy creature standing just a few feet away, watching me with bright, intelligent eyes. My heart quickens in fear, but I hold my ground, knowing that I'm not doing anything wrong. The creature takes a step forward, and I take a step back. We stand there for a moment, staring at each other, before the creature finally turns and lopes off into the darkness. I watch it go, my heart still pounding in my chest, before I finally turn and continue on my way down the mountain.
