I had just finished my last day of high school and was looking forward to a relaxing summer break. I was spending the first few weeks of my vacation at my grandparents' cottage in the country. It was a peaceful place, surrounded by fields and forests. I was sitting on the porch, watching the sunset. The sky was a beautiful orange, and the stars were just beginning to come out. I heard the sound of my grandfather playing the piano inside the cottage. It was a peaceful evening.
