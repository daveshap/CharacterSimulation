Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Bob is sitting in his bedroom, relaxing after a long day at work. He's sitting in an old, comfortable chair, with a cup of coffee in hand. The room is fairly simple, with a bed, a dresser, and a few other pieces of furniture. There are no decorations on the walls or anything else that would personalize the space. It's clear that Bob doesn't spend a lot of time in here. He takes a sip of his coffee and lets out a sigh. It's been a long day and he's ready to relax. He's just about to take another sip when he hears a knock at the door. He gets up to answer it and finds his neighbor, Mrs. Anderson, standing there. "Hello, Bob," she says. "I was just wondering if you could help me with something." Bob sets his coffee down and invites Mrs. Anderson into the house. She explains that her son is in the hospital and she's having a hard time getting ahold of her husband. She asks if Bob can watch her daughter for a few hours. Bob agrees to help, and Mrs. Anderson hands him a key. She thanks him and hurries off. Bob closes the door and heads back to his bedroom, where he finishes his coffee and contemplates his evening.

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I was just sitting in my bedroom, relaxing after a long day at work. I was in an old, comfortable chair, with a cup of coffee in hand. The room was fairly simple, with a bed, a dresser, and a few other pieces of furniture. There were no decorations on the walls or anything else that would personalize the space. It was clear that I didn't spend a lot of time in here. I took a sip of my coffee and let out a sigh. It had been a long day and I was ready to relax. I was just about to take another sip when I heard a knock at the door. I got up to answer it and found my neighbor, Mrs. Anderson, standing there. "Hello, Bob," she said. "I was just wondering if you could help me with something." I set my coffee down and invited Mrs. Anderson into the house. She explained that her son was in the hospital and she was having a hard time getting ahold of her husband. She asked if I could watch her daughter for a few hours. I agreed to help, and Mrs. Anderson handed me a key. She thanked me and hurried off. I closed the door and headed back to my bedroom, where I finished my coffee and contemplated my evening.
