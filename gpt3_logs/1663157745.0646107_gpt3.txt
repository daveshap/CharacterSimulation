Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Gabbi sat on the edge of the bed, watching the two children sleeping soundly in their beds. It had been a long day, and she was grateful to finally have a moment to herself. She sat in silence for a few minutes, enjoying the peace and quiet, before she heard a noise coming from the hallway. She got up quietly, careful not to wake the children, and went to investigate. She saw the outline of a man standing in the shadow at the end of the hallway, and her heart started to race. She knew she should call the police, but she was frozen in fear. The man started to come towards her, and Gabbi backed up into the bedroom, her mind racing. She looked around for a weapon, anything she could use to defend herself, but there was nothing. The man was getting closer and closer, and Gabbi could see the murderous look in his eyes. She knew she was going to die. Just as the man was about to reach her, she heard the sound of sirens in the distance. The man hesitated for a moment, then turned and ran out the front door. Gabbi collapsed to the floor, shaking and crying with relief. The police had arrived just in time.

==========

I sat on the edge of the bed, watching the two children sleeping soundly in their beds. It had been a long day, and I was grateful to finally have a moment to myself. I sat in silence for a few minutes, enjoying the peace and quiet, before I heard a noise coming from the hallway. I got up quietly, careful not to wake the children, and went to investigate. I saw the outline of a man standing in the shadow at the end of the hallway, and my heart started to race. I knew I should call the police, but I was frozen in fear. The man started to come towards me, and I backed up into the bedroom, my mind racing. I looked around for a weapon, anything I could use to defend myself, but there was nothing. The man was getting closer and closer, and I could see the murderous look in his eyes. I knew I was going to die. Just as the man was about to reach me, I heard the sound of sirens in the distance. The man hesitated for a moment, then turned and ran out the front door. I collapsed to the floor, shaking and crying with relief. The police had arrived just in time.
