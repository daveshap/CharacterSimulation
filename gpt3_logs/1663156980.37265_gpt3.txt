==========

The Eiffel Tower looms overhead as I walk through the city streets. I've been running my coffee shop for years, and I know every corner of this city like the back of my hand. I'm on my way to the market to stock up on supplies for the day, but I can't help but stop and admire the view. The morning sun casts a long shadow across the ground, and the few people around are hurrying to their destinations. After a moment, I shake myself out of my reverie and continue on my way.
