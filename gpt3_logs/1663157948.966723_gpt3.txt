The night was cool and clear, and the stars shone bright overhead. I felt a sense of wonder and awe as I looked at the magnificent structure. Suddenly, I heard a noise behind me. I turned around, but there was no one there. I scanned the area, but there was still no one to be seen. Then I heard the noise again, and this time it sounded like footsteps. My heart began to race as I realized someone was following me. I started to walk quickly, but the footsteps got faster too. Then I began to run, but the footsteps were right behind me. I was about to scream when I felt a hand clamp over my mouth.
