REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I arrived at my office building and headed to the coffee shop on the first floor. I greeted the barista and ordered my usual coffee. As I waited for my drink, I looked around the shop and noticed that it was fairly empty. I then saw a woman enter the shop and walk up to the counter. The woman looked around and then approached me. "Excuse me, do you work here?" she asked. I shook my head. "No, I don't." The woman looked disappointed and then said, "I'm looking for someone who can help me with my computer. It's been acting up all morning and I can't seem to fix it." I thought for a moment and then said, "Well, my friend John works in the IT department. Maybe he can help you." The woman thanked me and then headed to the IT department. I watched her go, then finished my coffee and headed to my own office.
