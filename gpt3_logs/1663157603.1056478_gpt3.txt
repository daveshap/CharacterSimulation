The sun is just peeking over the horizon as I open up my coffee shop for the day. I've been working hard to get my business off the ground, and I know that first impressions are important. I greet my first customer of the day with a friendly smile and ask him what I can get for him. He orders a cup of coffee, and I set to work making it. I chat with him as I work, making small talk about the weather and the news. The coffee shop quickly fills up with customers, and I'm kept busy serving them all. I love my job, and I can tell that my customers appreciate the care I take in making their coffee just the way they like it. The hours fly by, and soon it's time to close up shop. I say goodbye to my last customer of the day, flipping the sign on the door to 'closed'. I'm exhausted, but I'm also happy. I've worked hard to build up my business, and it's paying off. I can't wait to do it all again tomorrow.
