Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: The dense forest canopy blocks out most of the light, making it difficult to see more than a few feet in front of Tom. He's been walking for what seems like hours, and his feet are starting to ache. He's not sure if he's going in the right direction, but he knows he needs to find help soon. Suddenly, he hears a rustling in the bushes ahead of him. He freezes, listening intently. It could be an animal, or it could be someone waiting to ambush him. He carefully reaches into his pocket and grips his knife tightly, just in case. The rustling gets closer, and Tom can see a figure moving towards him through the darkness. He relaxes slightly when he realizes it's just a small monkey. The monkey climbs up his leg and onto his shoulder, chattering away excitedly. Tom continues walking, now with the monkey as his companion. He's not sure what he's going to find in the depths of the forest, but he knows he needs to keep moving.

I've been walking for hours, and my feet are starting to ache. I'm not sure if I'm going in the right direction, but I know I need to find help soon.

I carefully reach into my pocket and grip my knife tightly, just in case. The rustling gets closer, and I can see a figure moving towards me through the darkness. I relax slightly when I realize it's just a small monkey. The monkey climbs up my leg and onto my shoulder, chattering away excitedly. I continue walking, now with the monkey as my companion. I'm not sure what I'm going to find in the depths of the forest, but I know I need to keep moving.
