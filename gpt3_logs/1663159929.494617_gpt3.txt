SCENE: Mashawn is busy at work, hammering away at some bolts on the underside of the Eiffel Tower. He's been working on this section for a few hours now, and he's starting to get hungry. He takes a quick break to eat his lunch, sitting on a girder with his feet dangling over the edge. He looks out at the view of Paris spread out below him and takes a deep breath of the fresh air. What a day to be working on the Eiffel Tower!

I'm busy at work, hammering away at some bolts on the underside of the Eiffel Tower. I've been working on this section for a few hours now, and I'm starting to get hungry. I take a quick break to eat my lunch, sitting on a girder with my feet dangling over the edge. I look out at the view of Paris spread out below me and take a deep breath of the fresh air. What a day to be working on the Eiffel Tower!
