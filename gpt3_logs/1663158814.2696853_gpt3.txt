The sun was high in the sky, casting a bright glow over the city. I squinted as I made my way down the street. I had just finished my shift at the software company and was looking forward to getting home. As I turned the corner, I saw a group of people gathered around something. curious, I approached them to see what was going on. In the center of the group was a small child, no more than five years old. She was crying and clutching a teddy bear. "What's going on?" I asked. "This little girl got separated from her parents," someone said. "We're trying to help her find them." My heart went out to the child. I remember how scared I felt when I got lost in the city as a child. I offered to help look for the child's parents. For the next hour, I and the others searched the city for the child's parents. Finally, they were found and the little girl was reunited with her family. I felt good as I walked away from the scene. I was glad I could help.
