He's not really paying attention to what he's doing, his mind is elsewhere. He's thinking about his wife and child back home and how much he misses them. He's only been away for a few weeks, but it feels like an eternity. Suddenly, he hears a noise from the direction of the trees. He stands up, alert and ready to defend himself, but relaxes when he sees that it's just a rabbit. The rabbit doesn't seem to be bothered by the noise and continues munching on some grass.

==========

The sea is particularly rough tonight and the waves are crashing loudly against the shore. I'm using a stick to draw patterns in the sand. I'm not really paying attention to what I'm doing, my mind is elsewhere. I'm thinking about my wife and child back home and how much I miss them. I've only been away for a few weeks, but it feels like an eternity. Suddenly, I hear a noise from the direction of the trees. I stand up, alert and ready to defend myself, but relax when I see that it's just a rabbit. The rabbit doesn't seem to be bothered by the noise and continues munching on some grass. I sit back down and go back to my drawings. I'm not sure what to make of the rabbit, but decide to leave it be.
