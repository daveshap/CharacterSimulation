==========

I am totally lost. I've been walking around in circles for hours, and my clothes are all muddy and torn. I'm so tired and scared. I hear a noise in the distance and start to run, but I trip and fall. I look up and see a large, furry creature standing over me. I scream, but it is too late. The creature has already killed me.
