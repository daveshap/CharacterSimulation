She's gotten pretty good at sneaking in after everyone has gone home for the night. Tonight, Sandy is sitting at her desk, working on her computer. She's been up for a few hours, and she's starting to get tired. She's just about to call it a night when she hears a noise coming from the other side of the room.

Sandy is terrified, and she doesn't know what to do. She looks around the room for a way to escape, but the only way out is the door that the man is trying to get through. Sandy is trapped.

==========

I was just about to call it a night when I heard a noise coming from the other side of the room. I froze, listening to the noise. It sounded like someone was moving around in the other room. I was terrified, and I didn't know what to do. I slowly got up from my desk, trying to be as quiet as possible. I crept toward the door to the other room, listening for the noise. When I got to the door, I hesitated for a moment, then opened it slowly. Peeking into the other room, I saw a man rummaging through some papers on a desk. The man hadn't seen me, and I was relieved. I was about to turn and run when the man suddenly looked up and saw me. He froze for a moment, then started to run toward me. I screamed and ran back into the office, slamming the door shut behind me. I pressed my back against the door, trying to hold it shut, but the man was pounding on it, trying to get in. I was terrified, and I didn't know what to do. I looked around the room for a way to escape, but the only way out was the door that the man was trying to get through. I was trapped.
