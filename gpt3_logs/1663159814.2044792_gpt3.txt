As he walks into the bedroom, he notices that the window is open and the curtains are blowing in the breeze. He also sees that the bed is unmade and there are clothes strewn about the room. Wang is about to close the window when he hears a noise coming from the other side of the room. He freezes, not knowing what to do. Suddenly, a woman comes into the room. She's wearing a robe and her hair is wet, like she's just gotten out of the shower. She sees Wang and starts to scream. Wang quickly closes the window and tries to calm her down. He explains that he's just a delivery driver and that he didn't mean to scare her. Eventually, the woman calms down and Wang is able to leave the room.

==========

I was just finishing up my shift when I noticed the open window and blowing curtains. I also saw that the bed was unmade and there were clothes strewn about the room. I was about to close the window when I heard a noise coming from the other side of the room. I froze, not knowing what to do. Suddenly, a woman came into the room. She was wearing a robe and her hair was wet, like she'd just gotten out of the shower. She saw me and started to scream. I quickly closed the window and tried to calm her down. I explained that I was just a delivery driver and that I didn't mean to scare her. Eventually, she calmed down and I was able to leave the room. As I was walking down the hall, I could hear her screams echo in my mind.
