The sun beats down on me as I walk along the beach. I'm carrying a towel and a bag with my lunch in it. I find a spot to sit down and spread my towel out. I open my bag and take out my sandwich and a can of soda. I pop the can open and take a sip. I lean back against the towel and enjoy the sound of the waves crashing against the shore.
