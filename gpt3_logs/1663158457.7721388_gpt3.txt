The sky is just starting to lighten up, and the Eifel Tower looms large against the background of the Paris skyline. I'm standing at the base of the tower, looking up at it with a sense of wonder. I've never been to Paris before, and the sight of the tower is truly breathtaking. I can hear the sounds of the city starting to come to life all around me - cars honking, people talking, and the sound of a distant siren. The air is cold and crisp, and I can see my breath in the air. I'm here with my husband and two young children, who are still asleep in the hotel room. I know they'll be up soon, and I want to make the most of this moment before the day gets started. I stand there for a few minutes, taking in the sights and sounds of the city, before heading back to the hotel to wake my family up.
