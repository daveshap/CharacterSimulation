Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: She was already awake when the delivery driver arrived. She had been awake for hours, actually, her mind racing with anxious thoughts. She heard the driver pull up outside, and then a few moments later, a knock on the door. She forced herself to get out of bed and go answer it. The delivery driver, Wang, was standing there with a package in his hands. He smiled when she opened the door. "Good morning," he said. "I have a delivery for you." She took the package from him and set it down on the table inside the entryway. "Thank you," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "You're welcome," Wang said. He hesitated for a moment, sensing that something was wrong. "Is everything okay?" She shook her head. "No," she said. "Nothing is okay." Wang didn't know what to say. He stood there awkwardly for a moment before finally saying, "I'm sorry. I hope things get better for you." She nodded, not trusting herself to speak. She watched as Wang turned and walked back to his truck. Then she shut the door and leaned against it, the package still sitting on the table. She wondered what it could be. She wasn't expecting anything. She finally summon the courage to open it. Inside, she found a small box with a note attached. She opened the note and read it. "I'm sorry for everything. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me." She opened the box and found a necklace inside. It was the necklace she had been eyeing in the jewelry store window for weeks. The one she thought she could never afford. The note was signed by her husband. She put the necklace on and went to find him. They had a lot to talk about.

I was already awake when the delivery driver arrived. I had been awake for hours, actually, my mind racing with anxious thoughts. I heard the driver pull up outside, and then a few moments later, a knock on the door. I forced myself to get out of bed and go answer it.
