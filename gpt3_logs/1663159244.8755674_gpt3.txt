Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: The sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a soft pink and orange glow across the sky. The air is still and warm, with the promise of a hot day ahead. Birds are singing in the distance, and the sounds of locusts and other insects fill the air. Sandy is sitting on her porch, enjoying the peace and quiet of the morning. She is surrounded by the mud brick walls of her home, and the thatched roof provides shade from the sun. Sandy's children are still asleep inside, and she has a few moments to herself before the start of the busy day. She sips her tea and listens to the sounds of the African bush. Suddenly, she hears a loud crashing noise in the distance. Sandy knows that sound all too well - it's the sound of an elephant. She knows that if an elephant is nearby, it's best to stay inside and wait for it to pass. Sandy quickly gathers her things and goes inside, closing the door and windows tightly. She waits quietly, listening to the elephant moving around outside. After a few minutes, she hears it moving away and she relaxes, knowing that her family is safe.

The sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a soft pink and orange glow across the sky. The air is still and warm, with the promise of a hot day ahead. Birds are singing in the distance, and the sounds of locusts and other insects fill the air. I'm sitting on my porch, enjoying the peace and quiet of the morning. I'm surrounded by the mud brick walls of my home, and the thatched roof provides shade from the sun. My children are still asleep inside, and I have a few moments to myself before the start of the busy day. I sip my tea and listen to the sounds of the African bush. Suddenly, I hear a loud crashing noise in the distance. I know that sound all too well - it's the sound of an elephant. I know that if an elephant is nearby, it's best to stay inside and wait for it to pass. I quickly gather my things and go inside, closing the door and windows tightly. I wait quietly, listening to the elephant moving around outside. After a few minutes, I hear it moving away and I relax, knowing that my family is safe.
