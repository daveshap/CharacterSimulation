Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Tom is cleaning up the bar area, wiping down the counters and straightening up the bar stools. It's been a long day and he's ready to go home. He's just about finished when he hears a commotion coming from one of the offices down the hall. He can't make out what's being said, but it sounds like someone is in a lot of pain. Tom knows he shouldn't get involved, but he can't just ignore it. He slowly makes his way down the hall towards the office, trying to stay out of sight. As he gets closer, he can hear a man's voice, high-pitched and panicked. Tom peekes into the office and sees a man lying on the floor, clutching his chest. It's clear he's having a heart attack. Tom knows he needs to act fast. He races into the office and kneels down next to the man. He can see that he's not breathing and his skin is starting to turn blue. Tom realizes he needs to perform CPR. He's never done it before, but he knows he can't just stand there and do nothing. Tom starts compressions, counting out loud as he goes. He breathes into the man's mouth and continues the compressions. Suddenly, the man starts coughing and gasping for air. Tom has saved his life. The man is obviously shaken and very grateful. Tom helps him to his feet and helps him back to his office. He calls 911 to make sure the man gets the medical attention he needs. Tom knows he's done a good thing, but he's also feeling shaken up. It's been a long day, and this was definitely not what he was expecting when he came to work.

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I was just finishing up my shift at the bar when I heard a commotion coming from one of the offices down the hall. I couldn't make out what was being said, but it sounded like someone was in a lot of pain. I knew I shouldn't get involved, but I couldn't just ignore it. I slowly made my way down the hall towards the office, trying to stay out of sight. As I got closer, I could hear a man's voice, high-pitched and panicked. I peeked into the office and saw a man lying on the floor, clutching his chest. It was clear he was having a heart attack. I knew I needed to act fast. I raced into the office and kneeled down next to the man. I could see that he wasn't breathing and his skin was starting to turn blue. I realized I needed to perform CPR. I'd never done it before, but I knew I couldn't just stand there and do nothing. I started compressions, counting out loud as I went. I breathed into the man's mouth and continued the compressions. Suddenly, the man started coughing and gasping for air. I had saved his life. The man was obviously shaken and very grateful. I helped him to his feet and helped him back to his office. I called 911 to make sure the man got the medical attention he needed. I knew I'd done a good thing, but I was also feeling shaken up. It had been a long day, and this was definitely not what I was expecting when I came to work.
