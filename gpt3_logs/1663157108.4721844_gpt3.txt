SCENE: The sun is setting over the horizon, casting a beautiful orange hue in the sky. The birds are chirping and the wind is blowing gently through the trees. There's a sense of peace and tranquility in the air. Tom is sitting on the porch of his country cottage, enjoying the quiet evening. He's sipping on a beer and listening to the sounds of nature. He's got a smile on his face, and he looks content. Suddenly, the sound of a car engine breaks the silence. Tom gets up from his chair and walks to the edge of the porch, curious to see who's coming. A car comes into view, and Tom recognizes it as his neighbor's. He knows that they're going away for the weekend, so he's not sure why they're coming back. The car pulls up to the house and the door opens. Tom's neighbor, Bill, steps out. He looks distraught and there's a sense of urgency in his movements. Tom walks down the steps to meet him. "Bill, what's wrong? What's going on?" "It's my wife, Tom. She's in the car, and she's not breathing. I think she's had a heart attack."

The sun is setting over the horizon, casting a beautiful orange hue in the sky. The birds are chirping and the wind is blowing gently through the trees. There's a sense of peace and tranquility in the air. I'm sitting on the porch of my country cottage, enjoying the quiet evening. I'm sipping on a beer and listening to the sounds of nature. I've got a smile on my face, and I look content. Suddenly, the sound of a car engine breaks the silence. I get up from my chair and walk to the edge of the porch, curious to see who's coming. A car comes into view, and I recognize it as my neighbor's. I know that they're going away for the weekend, so I'm not sure why they're coming back. The car pulls up to the house and the door opens. My neighbor, Bill, steps out. He looks distraught and there's a sense of urgency in his movements. I walk down the steps to meet him. "Bill, what's wrong? What's going on?" "It's my wife, Tom.
