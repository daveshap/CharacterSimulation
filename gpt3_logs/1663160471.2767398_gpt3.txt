==========

I was cleaning up behind the bar, getting ready to close for the night, when I heard a noise coming from one of the offices down the hall. I cautiously approached the office, and peeks inside to see a man ransacking the place. The man was clearly agitated, and I was worried he might hurt someone, so I decided to intervene and confront him. I approached the man and asked him what he was doing. He replied that he was looking for something. I asked what he was looking for, but the man didn't answer. I told the man that he needed to leave the office and come with me. He resisted at first, but eventually agreed and went with me. I took the man outside and called the police. I told the dispatcher what happened and gave them the man's description. The man was still agitated and didn't say anything. The police arrived a few minutes later and took the man into custody. I was relieved that the situation was over and that no one was hurt.
