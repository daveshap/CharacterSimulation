I'm working the evening shift at the grocery store when I get a call from my boss. She tells me I can leave early, as there are no more customers and they can close up shop for the night. I'm happy to hear this news, as I was looking forward to getting home to my cozy country cottage. As I lock up the store and head out to my car, I can't help but notice how beautiful the night sky is. The stars are shining bright and the moon is full. I take a deep breath of fresh air and feel thankful for this moment of peace. When I arrive home, I'm greeted by my cat, who is meowing for food. I give her a scoop of food and then head to the kitchen to make myself a simple dinner. After eating, I settle down in front of the fireplace with a book. As I read, I can hear the sounds of the animals outside, which makes me feel even more at peace with the world.
