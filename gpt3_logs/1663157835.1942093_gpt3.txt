==========

I'm making my final delivery of the day to an office building. It's evening, and the office is mostly empty, with only a few lights still on in the windows. I pull up to the front of the building and park my van. I take the package out of the van and walk up to the front door of the building. I press the buzzer for the office, and after a moment, someone buzzes me in. I walk through the lobby and up to the elevator. I press the button for the floor my package is going to, and the elevator doors close. I ride the elevator up to the correct floor, and walk down the hallway to the correct office. I knock on the door, and after a moment, someone answers. I hand them the package and say goodbye. The person in the office thanks me and closes the door. I walk back to the elevator and press the button for the lobby. The elevator doors close, and I begin my ride back down to the lobby.
