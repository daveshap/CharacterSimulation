I've been so busy lately, with the kids and the house and just trying to keep everything together. It feels good to finally have a moment to myself. I walk down the steps and into the garden, admiring the flowers that are just starting to bloom. Suddenly, I hear a noise from the other side of the hedge. It sounds like someone is crying. I hesitate for a moment, unsure of what to do. But then I remember the time when I was in a similar situation, and how someone had helped me when I needed it most.
