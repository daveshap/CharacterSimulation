It's a sunny day in Paris, and I'm taking my kids to the park to play. We walk hand in hand through the streets, enjoying the sights and sounds of the city. When we reach the park, I let go of their hands and they run off to play. I sit down on a bench and watch as they explore the playground. After a few minutes, my phone starts ringing. I pull it out of my pocket and see that it's my husband calling. I answer the phone and he starts talking to me about his day at work. I listen patiently, occasionally interjecting with a question or comment. As we're talking, my kids come running up to me, asking for a snack. I tell my husband I have to go and end the call. I reach into my bag and pull out a granola bar, handing it to my kids. They sit down on the bench next to me and start eating. I watch as the kids play and enjoy the peaceful moment.
