Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Bob carefully steps over the shining, wet sand as he makes his way to the shoreline. The tide reaches his feet with an icy touch, quickly receding back and pulling the now wet sand beneath his feet with it. A sharp breeze cuts through the air, briefly stinging his skin before blowing his hair into his face. He squints through the darkness, trying to make out the figures of the other people on the beach. He can just make out their silhouettes against the light of the full moon. Bob wraps his arms around himself, trying to ward off the chill. He's not used to the cold weather here, having just moved from his native country a few months ago. He misses the warmth of the sun on his skin and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. He takes a deep breath, smelling the salt in the air and listening to the sound of the waves. Suddenly, he hears a noise behind him. He whips around, his heart pounding in his chest. He doesn't see anything, but he knows he's not alone. He starts to back away slowly, his feet sinking into the sand with each step. He trips over something and falls to the ground. He frantically looks around, trying to see what tripped him. And then he sees it. There's a body lying in the sand, just a few feet away from him. Bob scrambled to his feet, his heart racing. He slowly approaches the body, not knowing what to expect. He can see that it's a man, and he appears to be dead. There's a large wound on his chest, and his eyes are glassy and lifeless. Bob feels sick to his stomach. He's never seen a dead body before, and he doesn't know what to do. He looks around, half-expecting to see the killer still lurking in the shadows. But there's no one there. He's completely alone. He takes a few deep breaths, trying to calm himself down. He knows he should go for help, but he's too scared to move. He's not sure what to do.

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I carefully step over the shining, wet sand as I make my way to the shoreline. The tide reaches my feet with an icy touch, quickly receding back and pulling the now wet sand beneath my feet with it. A sharp breeze cuts through the air, briefly stinging my skin before blowing my hair into my face. I squint through the darkness, trying to make out the figures of the other people on the beach. I can just make out their silhouettes against the light of the full moon. I wrap my arms around myself, trying to ward off the chill. I'm not used to the cold weather here, having just moved from my native country a few months ago. I miss the warmth of the sun on my skin and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. I take a deep breath, smelling the salt in the air and listening to the sound of the waves. Suddenly, I hear a noise behind me. I whips around, my heart pounding in my chest. I don't see anything, but I know I'm not alone. I starts to back away slowly, my feet sinking into the sand with each step. I trip over something and falls to the ground. I frantically looks around, trying to see what tripped me. And then I sees it. There's a body lying in the sand, just a few feet away from me. I scrambled to my feet, my heart racing. I slowly approaches the body, not knowing what to expect. I can see that it's a man, and he appears to be dead. There's a large wound on his chest, and his eyes are glassy and lifeless. I feels sick to my stomach. I've never seen a dead body before, and I don't know what to do. I look around, half-expecting to see the killer still lurking in the shadows. But there's no one there.
