REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I was busy at work, hammering away at some nails that had come loose on the Eiffel Tower. I'd been working on this project for weeks now, and I was getting tired. But I knew that I had to keep going until the job was done. Suddenly, I heard a loud noise from above. I looked up just in time to see the beam I'd been working on starting to collapse. I tried to run out of the way, but I wasn't fast enough. The beam hit me on the head, and I fell to the ground, unconscious.
