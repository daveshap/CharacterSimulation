==========

I'm Tom, a bartender at a local pub in Africa. It's a hot day, and the customers are few and far between. I'm sweating as I mix drinks and try to stay cool. Suddenly, the door to the pub flies open and a group of men burst in, brandishing guns and shouting. I freeze as the men begin to rough up the customers and demand money. One of the men grabs me and puts a gun to my head, demanding that I open the safe. I'm terrified, but I know that I have to do as they say. I open the safe and the men begin to stuff the money into their bags. Suddenly, there is a commotion outside and the men start to panic. They shout at me to stay put as they run out of the pub. I don't know what to do, but I know that I have to act fast. I grab a bottle of vodka and start to pour it into a glass. As I do, I hear the sound of gunshots and screams coming from outside. I know that the men are killing people, and I know that I have to do something to stop them. I grab a knife and start to cut the rope that is holding the safe shut. I know that it's risky, but I have to try. I hear the men coming back into the pub, and I know that I only have a few seconds to act. I cut through the rope and the safe falls to the ground with a thud. The men run over to me, but I'm already running out the door. I hear them shouting and firing their guns, but I don't stop. I know that I have to get help. I have to warn people about the men and stop them from killing anyone else.
