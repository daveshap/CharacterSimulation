I arrived at my office building early in the morning, as I usually did. I was a software engineer and worked on developing new software for the company. As I entered the building, I greeted the security guard and made my way to the elevator. I pressed the button for my floor and waited patiently as the elevator ascended. Once I arrived at my floor, I walked down the hallway to my cubicle. I sat down and booted up my computer, ready to start my workday.
