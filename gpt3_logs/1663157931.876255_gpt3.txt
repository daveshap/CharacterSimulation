Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Aleksy slowly opens his eyes, blinking in the early morning light that's streaming in through the window. He feels a bit groggy after sleeping for longer than usual, but he knows he needs to get moving. He slowly sits up in bed, running a hand through his disheveled hair. He swings his legs over the side of the bed and stands up, stretching his arms above his head. He stifles a yawn as he makes his way over to the window, pushing aside the curtains to get a better view of the day outside. The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, and the sky is a beautiful shade of pink and orange. Aleksy can't help but smile at the sight; it's one of his favorite times of day. He glances at the clock on the nightstand and realizes he's running late. He quickly grabs a pair of jeans and a shirt from his dresser and throws them on, not bothering to button up the shirt. He grabs his keys and wallet from the nightstand and heads for the door. As he steps out into the hallway, he can hear his roommates moving around in the kitchen. He knows they'll give him a hard time about sleeping in, but he can't help it. He's just not a morning person. Aleksy makes his way down the hallway and into the kitchen, where his roommates are already eating breakfast. They greet him with good-natured teasing, and he responds with a sleepy grin. He grabs a piece of toast from the plate on the counter and takes a seat at the table,wash down the toast with a cup of coffee. He knows he'll be wide awake soon enough.

==========

I slowly open my eyes, blinking in the early morning light that's streaming in through the window. I feel a bit groggy after sleeping for longer than usual, but I know I need to get moving. I slowly sit up in bed, running a hand through my disheveled hair. I swing my legs over the side of the bed and stand up, stretching my arms above my head. I stifle a yawn as I make my way over to the window, pushing aside the curtains to get a better view of the day outside. The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, and the sky is a beautiful shade of pink and orange. I can't help but smile at the sight; it's one of my favorite times of day. I glance at the clock on the nightstand and realize I'm running late. I quickly grab a pair of jeans and a shirt from my dresser and throw them on, not bothering to button up the shirt. I grab my keys and wallet from the nightstand and head for the door. As I step out into the hallway, I can hear my roommates moving around in the kitchen. I know they'll give me a hard time about sleeping in, but I can't help it. I'm just not a morning person. I make my way down the hallway and into the kitchen, where my roommates are already eating breakfast. They greet me with good-natured teasing, and I respond with a sleepy grin.
