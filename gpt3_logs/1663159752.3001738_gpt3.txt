SCENE: Wang is driving his truck along the quiet beach. It's a beautiful day, and the sun is shining. He sees a group of people in the distance, and he slows down. As he gets closer, he can see that they're playing volleyball. He smiles and keeps driving. Further down the beach, he sees a woman sunbathing. He can't help but stare at her for a moment. She's wearing a bikini, and she has a great body. He averts his eyes and continues driving. He eventually arrives at his destination, a small cottage by the beach. He parks his truck and starts to unload the boxes. He's just about finished when he sees the woman from the beach walking towards him. She's carrying a beach towel and a bottle of sunscreen. "Hi," she says. "Do you need some help with those?" Wang smiles and nods. "Sure, thanks." Together, they finish unloading the boxes and carry them into the cottage. Wang can't help but feel attracted to the woman, and he can tell that she feels the same way about him. However, they both know that nothing can happen between them, so they just enjoy each other's company and go their separate ways.

==========

I'm driving my truck along the beach when I see a group of people playing volleyball. I smile and keep driving. Further down the beach, I see a woman sunbathing. I can't help but stare at her for a moment. She's wearing a bikini, and she has a great body. I avert my eyes and continue driving. I eventually arrive at my destination, a small cottage by the beach. I park my truck and start to unload the boxes. I'm just about finished when I see the woman from the beach walking towards me. She's carrying a beach towel and a bottle of sunscreen. "Hi," she says. "Do you need some help with those?" I smile and nod. "Sure, thanks." Together, we finish unloading the boxes and carry them into the cottage. I can't help but feel attracted to the woman, and I can tell that she feels the same way about me. However, we both know that nothing can happen between us, so we just enjoy each other's company and go our separate ways.
