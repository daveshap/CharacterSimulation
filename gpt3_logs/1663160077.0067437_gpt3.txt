She feels a sense of peace and accomplishment, knowing that her work is helping to make life better for people back home. Suddenly, Swathi's peace is shattered by a loud beeping sound. Her computer is telling her that there's an incoming transmission from Earth. Swathi hurriedly opens the connection, and her boss's face appears on the screen.
