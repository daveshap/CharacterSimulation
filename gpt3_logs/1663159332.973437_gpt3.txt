Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: The sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow over the mountainside. A chill wind is blowing, making the trees sway and the leaves dance. Mashawn is standing on the top of the mountain, his arms crossed over his chest to keep warm. He's wearing a heavy coat and a hard hat, and he's looking out over the valley below. In the distance, he can see the construction site where he's been working for the past few weeks. It's a huge project, and he's proud to be a part of it. He can't wait to see the finished product.
