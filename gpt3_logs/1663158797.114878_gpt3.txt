As the sun sets over Paris, the city's most iconic landmark comes to life. The Eiffel Tower is illuminated by thousands of twinkling lights, creating a magical atmosphere. I'm a software engineer from India, and this is my first time visiting the city. I've been mesmerized by the tower all day, and now I'm finally getting a chance to see it up close. I approach the tower, walking along the promenade that surrounds it. I can hear the faint strains of music coming from somewhere nearby, and I can see couples strolling hand in hand. The air is crisp and fresh, and the stars are beginning to come out. As I get closer to the tower, I can see that it's even more impressive than I'd imagined. I can't believe I'm really here. I snap some photos on my phone, then stand there for a moment, just taking it all in. Finally, I turn to walk back to my hotel. I know I'll never forget this night.
