Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, painting the mountaintop in a pink and orange glow. Gabbi is sitting on a large rock, watching the sunrise with a content look on her face. She's been up here for a couple of hours, ever since she got the call from the parents of her charges. The family is vacationing in Europe and their regular babysitter had to back out at the last minute, so Gabbi stepped in. She's never been to this part of the world before, but she's fallen in love with it already. The fresh mountain air is invigorating, and she can't get over how beautiful the scenery is. She's been keeping an eye on the two kids she's been hired to watch, making sure they don't wander off and get lost. But they're both fast asleep in their tents, and Gabbi is feeling a bit bored. Suddenly, she hears a rustling in the bushes. She tenses up, wondering if it's a wild animal. But then she sees a small rabbit poking its head out, and she relaxes. She watches the rabbit for a few minutes, before her eyes start to droop. The fresh air and the early morning hours are starting to take their toll, and Gabbi finds herself nodding off. She's just about to drift off to sleep when she hears the sound of voices coming from down the mountain. She jolts awake, her heart racing. It sounds like a group of people are coming up the trail. Gabbi quickly grabs her binoculars and focuses in on the group. They look like they're carrying heavy packs, and they're all wearing hiking boots. It looks like they're headed for the campsite. She watches as they set up their tents and start a fire. They don't look like they're planning on staying long, but Gabbi knows she needs to go down and introduce herself. She doesn't want the parents to find out she let strangers set up camp so close to their children. She carefully makes her way down the mountain, greeting the strangers with a friendly smile. After a brief conversation, she learns that they're just a group of hikers who got lost on the trail. They're not planning on staying long, and they promise to keep their noise to a minimum. Gabbi breathes a sigh of relief and heads back up the mountain to her post. It looks like it's going to be a long, boring day after all.

The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, painting the mountaintop in a pink and orange glow. I'm sitting on a large rock, watching the sunrise with a content look on my face. I've been up here for a couple of hours, ever since I got the call from the parents of my charges. The family is vacationing in Europe and their regular babysitter had to back out at the last minute, so I stepped in.
