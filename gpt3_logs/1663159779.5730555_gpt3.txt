Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Wang is driving his delivery truck up a narrow, winding mountain road. The sun is shining and the sky is blue, but the air is cool and Wang can see his breath in the truck's cab. As he nears the top of the mountain, Wang sees a beautiful castle perched atop a rocky outcropping. He slows the truck and stares at the imposing structure for a moment before continuing on. A few minutes later, Wang arrives at the castle gates and stops the truck. He climbs down and opens the gates, then drives the truck through. A moment later, he is standing in front of the castle, looking up at its towering facade. Wang feels a sudden sense of dread, but he shakes it off and approaches the castle door. He knocks and waits, but there is no answer. He knocks again, louder this time, but still there is no response. Wang begins to feel uneasy. He looks around, but there is no one in sight. He decides to leave and come back later. As he turns to go, he sees a movement in one of the castle windows. He freezes, heart pounding, but there is no further movement. Wang tells himself it was just his imagination and backs away from the castle slowly. He gets back in his truck and drives down the mountain, never once looking back.

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

As I drive my delivery truck up the narrow, winding mountain road, I can't help but stare at the beautiful castle perched atop a rocky outcropping. It's an imposing structure, and it fills me with a sense of dread. I shake it off and continue on, arriving at the castle gates a few minutes later. I climb down and open them, then drive the truck through. A moment later, I'm standing in front of the castle, looking up at its towering facade. I knock on the door, but there's no answer. I knock again, louder this time, but still there's no response. I begin to feel uneasy. I look around, but there's no one in sight. I decide to leave and come back later. As I turn to go, I see a movement in one of the castle windows. I freeze, heart pounding, but there is no further movement. I tell myself it was just my imagination and back away from the castle slowly. I get back in my truck and drive down the mountain, never once looking back.
