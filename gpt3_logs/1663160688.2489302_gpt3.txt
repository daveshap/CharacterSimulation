I straighten the last of the chairs and step back to survey my handiwork. My coffee shop looks inviting, with its soft lighting and comfortable chairs. The rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee hangs in the air, tantalizing customers as they walk by. I'm nervous. This is my first day open for business, and I don't know if anyone will come. I know there are other coffee shops in the area, but I'm hopeful that mine will be the one that stands out. I take a deep breath and go to the counter to wait for customers.
