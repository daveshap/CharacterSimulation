Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: It was a cold, clear day on the mountaintop. Jenna had been hiking for hours, and she was finally nearing the top. She could see the sun beginning to set, and the view was breathtaking. As she reached the summit, she saw a small cabin perched on the edge of a cliff. It looked abandoned, but she decided to check it out anyway. The door was unlocked, and she stepped inside. It was musty and dusty, but it appeared to be unused. She explored the small cabin, and eventually made her way to the bedroom. There was a small bed in the corner, and a window overlooking the valley below. Jenna sat down on the bed and watched the sun set. It was a beautiful sight, and she felt at peace.

I had been hiking for hours when I finally reached the top of the mountain. The view was breathtaking, and I could see the sun beginning to set. As I reached the summit, I saw a small cabin perched on the edge of a cliff. It looked abandoned, but I decided to check it out anyway. The door was unlocked, and I stepped inside. It was musty and dusty, but it appeared to be unused. I explored the small cabin, and eventually made my way to the bedroom. There was a small bed in the corner, and a window overlooking the valley below. I sat down on the bed and watched the sun set. It was a beautiful sight, and I felt at peace.
