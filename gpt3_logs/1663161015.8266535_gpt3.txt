==========

The sun is beginning to set as I finish up my daily swim. I climb out of the water, feeling refreshed and invigorated, and wrap a towel around my waist. I walk over to my beach chair and sit down, taking in the peace and quiet of the evening. I enjoy the sound of the waves crashing against the shore and the smell of the salt in the air. I close my eyes and let out a deep breath, feeling thankful for this moment of solitude. Suddenly, I hear a loud noise coming from the direction of the coffee shop. I open my eyes and see a group of kids running and laughing, throwing things around and acting like they're having the time of their lives. I know that I should probably go over and see what's going on, but I can't help but feel a little annoyed at the disruption of my peaceful evening. I get up from my chair and walk towards the coffee shop, my towel trailing behind me in the sand. As I get closer, I can see that the kids have broken into the shop and are helping themselves to the food and drink. I quicken my pace, but before I can reach the shop, the kids scatter and are gone. I enter the shop and assess the damage. I see that the cash register is open and the till is empty. All of the food and drink has been taken. I feel a mix of anger and sadness as I survey the mess that the kids have made. I know that it will take a lot of work to clean up and restock the shop, but I'm determined to do it.
