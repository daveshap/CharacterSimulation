Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Sandy is standing on the surface of the moon, basking in the eerie silence and stillness. She's wearing a bulky spacesuit and carrying a large oxygen tank on her back. In her hand, she holds a small American flag. She looks up at the Earth, hanging bright and blue in the sky, and feels a surge of pride and patriotism. This is a historic moment: she's the first human being to walk on the moon. Suddenly, she hears a crackling sound in her earpiece. It's Houston, trying to reach her. "Sandy, can you hear me? Come in, Sandy." "Loud and clear, Houston," she says, her voice trembling with excitement. She begins to walk, her booted feet leaving deep footprints in the powdery surface. She's on her way to plant the American flag on the moon.

==========

I'm standing on the surface of the moon, basking in the eerie silence and stillness. I'm wearing a bulky spacesuit and carrying a large oxygen tank on my back. In my hand, I hold a small American flag. I look up at the Earth, hanging bright and blue in the sky, and feel a surge of pride and patriotism. This is a historic moment: I'm the first human being to walk on the moon. Suddenly, I hear a crackling sound in my earpiece. It's Houston, trying to reach me. "Sandy, can you hear me? Come in, Sandy." "Loud and clear, Houston," I say, my voice trembling with excitement. I begin to walk, my booted feet leaving deep footprints in the powdery surface. I'm on my way to plant the American flag on the moon.
