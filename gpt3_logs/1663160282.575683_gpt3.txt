==========

I'm walking through the dark forest, early in the morning. I've got a large basket of laundry on my head, and my two-year-old daughter Mia on my back. I'm wearing a long, brightly colored dress and a scarf around my head. I'm singing softly to myself as I walk. Suddenly, I hear a noise in the bushes. I stop and listen, but I don't see anything. I start to walk again, but the noise gets louder. This time, I see a large snake slithering towards me. I scream and try to run away, but the snake is too fast. It wraps itself around my leg and starts to squeeze. I fall to the ground, still screaming. Mia starts to cry. I try to reach for my daughter, but the snake is constricting my body. I can't move. The snake tightens its grip and I stop screaming. My body goes limp and I die. Mia continues to cry, until she finally falls asleep from exhaustion.
