Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: It's a cold, dark night on the moon. Tom is bartending at the only bar in town, The Lunar Lounge. It's a quiet night, with only a few customers. Tom is wiping down the bar, when he sees a familiar face walk in. It's Jack, a regular at the bar. "Hey, Jack. What can I get you tonight?" "Just a whiskey, Tom. neat." Tom pours a glass of whiskey for Jack and slides it across the bar. "You look like you've seen a ghost, Jack. What's up?" "I just saw something out on the plains. Something...unnatural." "What do you mean?" "I don't know. I can't explain it. But it was definitely something not of this world." Tom leans in, interested in what Jack has to say. "What did it look like?" "I don't know. It was dark, and I couldn't see it clearly. But it was big. And it was moving fast." "Did it see you?" "I don't know. I don't think so. I'm not sure." "What did you do?" "I turned and ran the other way. I didn't want to stick around to find out what it was." Tom nods his head, understanding. "I don't blame you, Jack. But whatever it was, it's not your fault. These things happen." "I know. But I can't help but feel like it's my fault. Like I shouldn't have been there." "Don't blame yourself, Jack. There's nothing you could have done." Tom pours Jack another drink, and the two men sit in silence, contemplating what Jack saw.

==========

I'm bartending at the Lunar Lounge tonight, and it's been pretty quiet. I'm just wiping down the bar when I see Jack walk in. He's a regular here, so I know him pretty well. "Hey, Jack. What can I get you tonight?" "Just a whiskey, Tom. neat." I pour him a glass of whiskey and slide it across the bar. He looks like he's seen a ghost. "You look like you've seen a ghost, Jack. What's up?" "I just saw something out on the plains. Something...unnatural." "What do you mean?" "I don't know. I can't explain it. But it was definitely something not of this world." I lean in, interested in what he has to say. "What did it look like?" "I don't know. It was dark, and I couldn't see it clearly. But it was big. And it was moving fast." "Did it see you?" "I don't know. I don't think so. I'm not sure." "What did you do?" "I turned and ran the other way. I didn't want to stick around to find out what it was." I nod my head, understanding. "I don't blame you, Jack. But whatever it was, it's not your fault. These things happen." "I know. But I can't help but feel like it's my fault. Like I shouldn't have been there." "Don't blame yourself, Jack. There's nothing you could have done." I pour him another drink, and the two of us sit in silence, contemplating what he saw.
