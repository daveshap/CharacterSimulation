REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I was sitting at my desk, eating my lunch and scrolling through Facebook on my phone. I saw a post about a new grocery store that was opening up down the street from my office. I was curious, so I finished my lunch and went to check it out. When I got there, I saw that the store was already pretty busy. I browsed the shelves for a bit, but didn't see anything that I wanted to buy. I did, however, see a sign for a job opening. I was interested, so I filled out an application. After I finished the application, I went back to my office. I wasn't sure if I would get the job, but I was excited at the possibility of working closer to my office.
