Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: The alarm clock goes off, startling Jenna awake. She rubs her eyes groggily as she sits up, looking around her small, cramped bedroom. The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow over the cityscape. Jenna stretches her arms over her head with a yawn before getting out of bed and padding over to her window. She looks down at the busy street below, watching as people hurry to and fro. Jenna can see the sidewalk cafe across the street, already starting to fill up with early morning commuters grabbing a quick cup of coffee before heading into the office. She can hear the hustle and bustle of the city as cars zoom down the street and sirens wail in the distance. Jenna lets out a sigh as she turns away from the window and goes to get ready for school. She has a busy day ahead of her, and she knows she won't have time to enjoy the peace and quiet of the morning for long.

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I woke up to the sound of my alarm blaring, and it took me a few seconds to remember where I was. I Rubbed my eyes groggily as I sat up, looking around my small, cramped bedroom. The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow over the cityscape. I stretched my arms over my head with a yawn before getting out of bed and padding over to my window. I looked down at the busy street below, watching as people hurried to and fro. I could see the sidewalk cafe across the street, already starting to fill up with early morning commuters grabbing a quick cup of coffee before heading into the office. I could hear the hustle and bustle of the city as cars zoomed down the street and sirens wailed in the distance. I let out a sigh as I turned away from the window and went to get ready for school. I had a busy day ahead of me, and I knew I wouldn't have time to enjoy the peace and quiet of the morning for long.
