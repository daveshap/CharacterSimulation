==========

I wake up to the sun just starting to peek over the horizon. The warm glow casts a peaceful feeling over the countryside. The birds singing in the trees and the light breeze stirring the leaves makes me feel so calm and content. I stretch and yawn before getting out of bed and going to the window. I look out at the beautiful morning and can't help but smile. I head to the kitchen to start my day.
