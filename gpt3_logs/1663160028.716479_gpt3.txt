I'm sitting on a bench in the park, enjoying my lunch break. The sun is shining and the birds are chirping. I people-watch for a while, enjoying the happy hustle and bustle of the city. I take out my sandwich and take a bite, savoring the deliciousness. I notice a group of children playing tag nearby, and I can't help but smile at their innocence. Suddenly, my phone rings, and I answer it. It's my boss, telling me that I'm needed back on the job site. I sigh, but I know I have to get back to work. I wrap up my lunch, say goodbye to the happy city scene, and head back to the construction site.
