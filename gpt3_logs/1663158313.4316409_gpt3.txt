Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Aleksy had been waiting all night for this moment. He was in the middle of the concert, surrounded by the pulsing music and the cheering crowd. He felt alive. This was what he lived for. For a moment, he forgot about his mundane life as a grocery store clerk. He was transported to a world of excitement and adventure. He danced and sang along with the music, losing himself in the moment. Suddenly, the music stopped and the lights came on. Aleksy blinked, disoriented. The spell was broken. He was back in the real world. As the crowd filed out of the venue, Aleksy felt deflated. He slowly made his way back to the grocery store, his home for the past four years. He was starting to feel like he was too old for this. Maybe it was time to move on.

I'd been waiting all night for this moment. I was in the middle of the concert, surrounded by the pulsing music and the cheering crowd. I felt alive. This was what I lived for. For a moment, I forgot about my mundane life as a grocery store clerk. I was transported to a world of excitement and adventure. I danced and sang along with the music, losing myself in the moment. Suddenly, the music stopped and the lights came on. I blinked, disoriented. The spell was broken. I was back in the real world. As the crowd filed out of the venue, I felt deflated. I slowly made my way back to the grocery store, my home for the past four years. I was starting to feel like I was too old for this. Maybe it was time to move on.
