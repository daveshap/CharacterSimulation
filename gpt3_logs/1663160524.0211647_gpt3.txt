I'm thinking about how I'm going to decorate my coffee shop for Christmas, and I'm looking forward to the holidays. Suddenly, I hear a noise behind me, and I turn to see a group of people walking towards me. They're all carrying supplies and weapons, and they're wearing dark clothing. I realize they're robbers, and I start to run. The robbers see me, and they give chase. I'm running as fast as I can, but I'm not used to running and I'm quickly getting tired. The robbers are gaining on me, and I know I won't be able to outrun them. I look around desperately for help, but there's no one around. I'm about to give up when I hear a loud noise, and the ground starts shaking. The Eiffel Tower is coming down, and it's heading straight for the robbers.
