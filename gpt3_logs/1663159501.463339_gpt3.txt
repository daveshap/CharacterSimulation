Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Mashawn had been working on the lunar construction site for weeks, and he was starting to get used to the eerie stillness of the place. But this morning, something was different. He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but there was an uneasiness in the air. He tried to shake it off as he went about his work, but the feeling only grew stronger. And then he heard it. A low, rumbling sound, like something was stirring deep beneath the surface of the moon. He froze, his heart pounding in his chest. What was it? Was something coming for him? He didn't have long to wonder, because in the next instant, the ground beneath his feet began to shake. He stumbled and fell as massive cracks appeared in the ground, and then something began to emerge from the hole. It was a giant creature, unlike anything he had ever seen. It was black and glossy, with dozens of long, segmented legs. It towered over him, its huge eyes glaring down at him. He scrambled to his feet and tried to run, but the creature was faster. It lunged at him, and he felt its sharp teeth sink into his flesh. Then everything went black.
