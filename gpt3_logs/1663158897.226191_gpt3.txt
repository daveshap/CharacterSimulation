REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I'm exhausted as I walk through the door after a long day at work. I know I need to get started on my evening chores, but first I head to the bedroom to change out of my work clothes. I strip down to my boxers and climb into bed, letting out a deep sigh of relief. The sheets are cool and feel good against my skin. I close my eyes and allow myself to relax for a few minutes before I get up to start on my chores.
