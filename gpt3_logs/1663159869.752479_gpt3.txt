I was walking along the beach, enjoying the last bit of daylight before it got too dark. The air was still and the waves were crashing gently against the shore. I loved this time of day, when everything seemed so peaceful. Suddenly, I heard a noise behind me and turned around to see a man walking towards me. He looked Asian and was wearing a hoodie, so I couldn't see his face. He was walking quickly and seemed to be carrying something in his hand. I started to feel scared and ran towards the nearest house. The man ran after me and when I looked back, I saw that he had a knife in his hand. I screamed for help, but no one was around. The man caught up to me and pulled me into an alleyway. I begged for my life, but the man didn't say anything. He just stared at me with cold, lifeless eyes. Then, he raised the knife and I felt a sharp pain in my stomach. I collapsed to the ground and everything went black.
