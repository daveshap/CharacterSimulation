Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Jenna enters her bedroom and flops down on her bed. She stares up at the ceiling, lost in thought. Her mind is racing and she can't seem to focus on anything. She's trying to study for her upcoming biology test, but she can't seem to concentrate. Suddenly, her phone buzzes. She sits up and grabs it, eager for a distraction. It's a text from her best friend, asking if she wants to come over and hang out. Jenna responds quickly, saying she'll be right there. She stands up and grabs her jacket, then heads for the door. She paused for a moment, hand on the doorknob, and takes a deep breath. She can do this. She's just a little stressed, that's all. She can't let her anxiety get the best of her. She opens the door and steps out into the hallway, then heads for her friend's house.

==========

I enter my bedroom and flop down on my bed. I stare up at the ceiling, lost in thought. My mind is racing and I can't seem to focus on anything. I'm trying to study for my upcoming biology test, but I can't seem to concentrate. Suddenly, my phone buzzes. I sit up and grab it, eager for a distraction. It's a text from my best friend, asking if I want to come over and hang out. I respond quickly, saying I'll be right there. I stand up and grab my jacket, then head for the door. I paused for a moment, hand on the doorknob, and take a deep breath. I can do this. I'm just a little stressed, that's all. I can't let my anxiety get the best of me. I open the door and step out into the hallway, then head for my friend's house.
