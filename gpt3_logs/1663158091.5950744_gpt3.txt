Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon as Wang weaves his way through the throng of people gathered in the park. He's got a delivery to make, and he doesn't want to be late. The concertgoers are milling about, chatting and laughing, enjoying the early morning air. There's a palpable excitement in the air - everyone knows that the headlining act is about to take the stage soon. Wang expertly navigates his way through the crowd, finally spotting his target near the front of the stage. He weaves his way over, being careful not to jostle anyone, and delivers the package. The recipient, a young woman, thanks him with a smile. She's got a good spot near the front, and she's obviously excited for the show. Wang turns to leave, but not before he's caught up in the excitement himself. He can't help but stop and watch as the first band takes the stage and starts to play. It's going to be a good day.

I'm weaving my way through the crowd, trying to make my delivery. The sun is just starting to come up, and the concertgoers are milling about, chatting and laughing. There's a palpable excitement in the air - everyone knows that the headlining act is about to take the stage soon. I finally spot my target near the front of the stage and make my way over. The recipient, a young woman, thanks me with a smile. She's got a good spot near the front, and she's obviously excited for the show. I turn to leave, but not before I'm caught up in the excitement myself. I can't help but stop and watch as the first band takes the stage and starts to play. It's going to be a good day.
