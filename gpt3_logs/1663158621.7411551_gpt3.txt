SCENE: The sun is just starting to set as Jenna walks through the market square. She's been out all day, exploring the town and visiting the local sights. She's a bit tired, but she still has energy to browse the stalls and see what's for sale. The market is busy, as it always is at this time of day. Jenna weaves her way through the crowd, looking at the different goods on offer. There are fruits and vegetables, bolts of cloth, handmade jewelry, and more. She pauses at one stall to admire a beautiful necklace, but she doesn't have enough money to buy it. As she continues to wander, she sees a group of people gathered around something. She gets closer and realizes they're watching a man performing acrobatics. He's flipping and twisting in the air, and the crowd is cheering him on. Jenna joins in, clapping and laughing along with the rest of the spectators. The acrobat finishes his routine to a round of applause, and Jenna moves on. She's enjoyed her day, but she's ready to head home now. She'll come back tomorrow and see what new treasures the market has to offer.

The sun is just starting to set as I walk through the market square. I've been out all day, exploring the town and visiting the local sights. I'm a bit tired, but I still have energy to browse the stalls and see what's for sale. The market is busy, as it always is at this time of day. I weave my way through the crowd, looking at the different goods on offer. There are fruits and vegetables, bolts of cloth, handmade jewelry, and more. I pause at one stall to admire a beautiful necklace, but I don't have enough money to buy it. As I continue to wander, I see a group of people gathered around something. I get closer and realize they're watching a man performing acrobatics. He's flipping and twisting in the air, and the crowd is cheering him on. I join in, clapping and laughing along with the rest of the spectators. The acrobat finishes his routine to a round of applause, and I move on. I've enjoyed my day, but I'm ready to head home now. I'll come back tomorrow and see what new treasures the market has to offer.
