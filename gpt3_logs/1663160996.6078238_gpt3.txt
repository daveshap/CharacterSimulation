I climb up the Eiffel Tower, my heart pounding in my chest. I've never been so high up before, and the view is breathtaking. I can see the whole city stretched out below me, the lights twinkling in the darkness. I feel a sudden gust of wind and hang on tight, my heart in my throat. But then I look up and see the moon shining overhead, and I feel a sudden sense of calm. I've never felt so alive before. I stay up there for hours, just staring at the view and soaking it all in. I've finally found a place where I feel truly free.
