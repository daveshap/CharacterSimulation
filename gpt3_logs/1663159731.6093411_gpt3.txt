REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I'm walking on the surface of the moon, enjoying the evening air. I'm wearing a suit that protects me from the harsh environment and my helmet has a tinted visor to keep the bright sun out of my eyes. I'm carrying a backpack with my supplies for the journey. I've been walking for hours, and I'm getting tired. I stop to rest for a few minutes, sitting on a large rock. I take a drink of water from my canteen and look up at the stars. I can't believe I'm really here on the moon. It's something I've always dreamed of doing, and I've finally made it. I get up and start walking again. I'm not sure how much further I have to go, but I know I'll find my way. After a while, I come to a small crater. I climb down into the crater and start to explore. I find some interesting rocks and take some pictures. I'm having the time of my life. Suddenly, I hear a noise. I turn around and see a large, dark creature standing at the edge of the crater, watching me. I'm terrified and don't know what to do. The creature starts to walk towards me, and I back away. I trip over a rock and fall, hitting my head on the ground. I pass out. When I wake up, I'm inside a spaceship. I have no idea how I got there. I see the creature that took me and it's not scary anymore. In fact, it looks kind of friendly. I'm surprised, but I'm not scared. I know I'm safe now.
