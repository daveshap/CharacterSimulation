Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Jenna cautiously enters the dark forest, stepping over fallen branches and sidestepping mud puddles. She's never been here before, and her heart pounds in her chest as she hears strange noises all around her. She tells herself to be brave -- she's come here on a mission, and she can't turn back now. Jenna's eyes adjust to the darkness, and she starts to make out the shapes of trees and bushes around her. Suddenly, something moves in the bushes ahead of her, and Jenna gasps. She raises her flashlight, but before she can see what it is, there's a loud rustling and the creature is gone. Jenna's heart is pounding so hard she can barely breathe, but she forces herself to keep going. She's been walking for what feels like hours, but she knows she can't be far from her destination. She emerges into a small clearing and sees a faint light flickering in the distance. Jenna starts to breathe a little easier -- she must be getting close. She walks towards the light, and as she gets closer, she sees that it's coming from a small cave. Jenna hesitates for a moment, but she knows she has to go in. She takes a deep breath and enters the cave. The light is coming from a fire in the center of the cave, and Jenna can see people gathered around it. They're all dressed in strange clothes, and they're chanting in a language Jenna doesn't understand. When they see her, they stop chanting and stare at her. Jenna's not sure what to do, but before she can say anything, the ground starts to shake. The people around the fire start to panicked, and Jenna hears someone yell, "The prophecy is coming true! She's here!"

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I cautiously enter the dark Forest, stepping over fallen branches and sidestepping mud puddles. I've never been here before, and my heart pounds in my chest as I hear strange noises all around me. I tell myself to be brave -- I've come here on a mission, and I can't turn back now. My eyes adjust to the darkness, and I start to make out the shapes of trees and bushes around me. Suddenly, something moves in the bushes ahead of me, and I gasp. I raise my flashlight, but before I can see what it is, there's a loud rustling and the creature is gone. My heart is pounding so hard I can barely breathe, but I force myself to keep going. I've been walking for what feels like hours, but I know I can't be far from my destination. I emerge into a small clearing and see a faint light flickering in the distance. I start to breathe a little easier -- I must be getting close. I walk towards the light, and as I get closer, I see that it's coming from a small cave. I hesitate for a moment, but I know I have to go in. I take a deep breath and enter the cave. The light is coming from a fire in the center of the cave, and I can see people gathered around it. They're all dressed in strange clothes, and they're chanting in a language I don't understand. When they see me, they stop chanting and stare at me. I'm not sure what to do, but before I can say anything, the ground starts to shake.
