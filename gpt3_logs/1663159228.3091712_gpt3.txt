Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Wang had been driving for hours, and was finally nearing the end of his shift. He was looking forward to getting home and getting some rest. As he pulled up to the address he'd been given, he frowned. It was clearly a residential area, and it was late at night. He was about to turn around and head back to the depot when he noticed a light on in one of the houses. He realized that this must be the right place after all. He pulled up to the house and got out of his car. He could see the light coming from a window on the second floor. He approached the house and knocked on the door. After a moment, a woman answered the door. She looked tired and worried. "I have a delivery for you," Wang said. The woman took the package from him. "Thank you," she said. "I'm sorry for the trouble." Wang shrugged. "It's no trouble. I'm just glad I could help." The woman thanked him again and then closed the door. Wang got back into his car and drove away.

I was driving for hours, and was finally nearing the end of my shift. I was looking forward to getting home and getting some rest. As I pulled up to the address I'd been given, I frowned. It was clearly a residential area, and it was late at night. I was about to turn around and head back to the depot when I noticed a light on in one of the houses. I realized that this must be the right place after all. I pulled up to the house and got out of my car. I could see the light coming from a window on the second floor. I approached the house and knocked on the door. After a moment, a woman answered the door. She looked tired and worried. "I have a delivery for you," I said. The woman took the package from me. "Thank you," she said. "I'm sorry for the trouble." I shrugged. "It's no trouble. I'm just glad I could help." The woman thanked me again and then closed the door. I got back into my car and drove away.
