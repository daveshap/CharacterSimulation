The sun is setting and the last of its rays are streaming in through the window, casting the room in a warm, orange glow. I'm in the process of getting ready for bed. I've changed into my pajamas and I'm now brushing my teeth at the sink. I spit into the sink and rinse my mouth out with water. I take a few swigs from a bottle of water before setting it back down on the counter. I walk over to the bed and climb in. I reach over to the bedside table and turn off the lamp, plunging the room into darkness. I settle down into the bed and close my eyes, ready to drift off to sleep.
