Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Jenna had always loved hiking, and when she found out her family would be spending a summer in Europe, she was determined to explore as many mountain trails as possible. So far, she had climbed some of the largest peaks in the Alps, and today she was setting her sights on one of the smaller ones. The sun was starting to set by the time Jenna reached the top of the mountain, but she wanted to enjoy the view for a little while longer before starting her descent. She sat down on a large rock and took in the sight of the valley below, the sleepy villages nestled among the rolling hills. It was so peaceful up here, Jenna thought to herself. She could understand why people loved to come to the mountains to get away from the hustle and bustle of daily life. After a few minutes, she got up and started to make her way back down the trail. She had only gone a few steps when she heard a rustling in the bushes. Jenna froze, her heart pounding in her chest. Could it be a wild animal? She didn't know if there were any dangerous animals in these mountains, but she didn't want to take any chances. Slowly, she started to back away from the bushes, but before she could get too far, a man stepped out from behind them. Jenna gasped and took a step back. The man was holding a knife, and he had a sinister look in his eyes. Jenna knew she was in trouble. There was no one around for miles, and she didn't know how to defend herself against a knife. She tried to think of something, anything, that could help her get out of this situation, but her mind was blank. The man took a step towards her, and Jenna stepped back again. She knew she was going to have to think of something fast.

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I always loved hiking, and when I found out my family would be spending a summer in Europe, I was determined to explore as many mountain trails as possible. So far, I had climbed some of the largest peaks in the Alps, and today I was setting my sights on one of the smaller ones. The sun was starting to set by the time I reached the top of the mountain, but I wanted to enjoy the view for a little while longer before starting my descent. I sat down on a large rock and took in the sight of the valley below, the sleepy villages nestled among the rolling hills. It was so peaceful up here, I thought to myself. I could understand why people loved to come to the mountains to get away from the hustle and bustle of daily life. After a few minutes, I got up and started to make my way back down the trail. I had only gone a few steps when I heard a rustling in the bushes. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest. Could it be a wild animal? I didn't know if there were any dangerous animals in these mountains, but I didn't want to take any chances. Slowly, I started to back away from the bushes, but before I could get too far, a man stepped out from behind them. I gasped and took a step back. The man was holding a knife, and he had a sinister look in his eyes. I knew I was in trouble. There was no one around for miles, and I didn't know how to defend myself against a knife. I tried to think of something, anything, that could help me get out of this situation, but my mind was blank. The man took a step towards me, and I stepped back again. I knew I was going to have to think of something fast.
