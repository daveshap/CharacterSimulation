REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I open my bedroom door and step inside. The room is a mess, with clothes and books strewn everywhere. I make my way to the bed and flop down onto it, letting out a sigh. I lie there for a few moments, staring up at the ceiling. Then I sit up and start picking up the clothes off the floor, putting them into a hamper. I neaten up the books on my desk and then flop back down onto the bed again. I pick up my phone and start scrolling through social media. After a few minutes, I put the phone down and get up again. I go over to my closet and start looking through my clothes. I try on a few outfits, standing in front of the mirror to see how they look. Finally, I settle on a pair of jeans and a shirt. I get dressed and then sit back down at my desk. I start working on my homework, but after a few minutes I get distracted and start playing on my phone again.
