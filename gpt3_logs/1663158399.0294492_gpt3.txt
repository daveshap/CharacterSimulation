Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Gabbi is nervously walking through a dark forest in South America, looking for the house she is supposed to be babysitting at. It is 6pm and she is already an hour late. She is carrying a flashlight and a bag of babysitting supplies. She is wearing a brightly colored shirt and pants so she will be easier to see in the darkness. She is also wearing a pair of sneakers in case she needs to run away from anything. Gabbi hears a branch snap and stops in her tracks, shining her flashlight in the direction of the noise. She sees a large, furry creature standing in the shadows, watching her. She gasps and backs away slowly, never taking her eyes off of the creature. The creature starts to come towards her and Gabbi turns and runs in the opposite direction. She can hear the creature following her, but she doesn't look back. She runs until she reaches the house she is supposed to be babysitting at and goes inside, locking the door behind her. She is safe for now, but she is sure the creature is still out there, lurking in the darkness.

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I'm nervously walking through a dark forest in South America, looking for the house I'm supposed to be babysitting at. It's 6pm and I'm already an hour late. I'm carrying a flashlight and a bag of babysitting supplies. I'm wearing a brightly colored shirt and pants so I'll be easier to see in the darkness. I'm also wearing a pair of sneakers in case I need to run away from anything. I hear a branch snap and stop in my tracks, shining my flashlight in the direction of the noise. I see a large, furry creature standing in the shadows, watching me. I gasp and back away slowly, never taking my eyes off of the creature. The creature starts to come towards me and I turn and run in the opposite direction. I can hear the creature following me, but I don't look back. I run until I reach the house I'm supposed to be babysitting at and go inside, locking the door behind me. I'm safe for now, but I'm sure the creature is still out there, lurking in the darkness.
