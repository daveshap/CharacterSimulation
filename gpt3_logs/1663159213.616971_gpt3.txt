They stop and stare at me as I drive by. I wave to them and they wave back. I then see a group of women walking along the road. They're carrying bundles of firewood on their heads. I honk my horn as I pass them. As I near the village, I see a group of men sitting in the shade of a tree. They're drinking beer and laughing. I honk my horn at them as I pass. I then arrive at the village. I deliver my goods to the storekeeper and then drive back to the main road.
