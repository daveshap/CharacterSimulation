Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: The air is crisp and cold on the mountaintop, with a strong wind blowing. Mashawn is wearing a heavy coat and gloves as he works, shoveling snow off the ground. He pauses occasionally to catch his breath, and looks around at the breathtaking view. In the distance, he can see the town he lives in, and the valleys and hills beyond. Mashawn has been working on this construction project for several weeks now, and he's getting close to finishing. He's been excited to see the finished product, and can't wait to show it off to his friends and family. Suddenly, Mashawn hears a loud noise behind him. He turns around to see a large boulder rolling down the hill towards him. He has just enough time to jump out of the way before it hits him. Mashawn is shaken up but uninjured. He looks at the boulder and sees that it has smashed the section of the wall he was working on. He sighs and starts to shovel the snow back into place. It's going to be a long day.

The air is crisp and cold on the mountaintop, with a strong wind blowing. I'm wearing a heavy coat and gloves as I work, shoveling snow off the ground. I pause occasionally to catch my breath, and look around at the breathtaking view. In the distance, I can see the town I live in, and the valleys and hills beyond. I've been working on this construction project for several weeks now, and I'm getting close to finishing. I've been excited to see the finished product, and can't wait to show it off to my friends and family. Suddenly, I hear a loud noise behind me. I turn around to see a large boulder rolling down the hill towards me. I have just enough time to jump out of the way before it hits me. I'm shaken up but uninjured.
