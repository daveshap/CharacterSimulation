Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Sandy is sitting in her hut, surrounded by her five children. It's been a long day and she's exhausted, but she knows she has to stay up a little longer to make sure her little ones are all fed and tucked in for the night. She starts a small fire in the center of the hut and begins to cook the evening meal. Her children watch eagerly as the pot of stew begins to simmer. Sandy ladles out bowls of steaming stew for her children and they all sit down to eat. As they eat, Sandy tells her children stories about her own childhood in Africa. She talks about the animals she used to see and the adventures she used to have. Her children listen raptly, their eyes wide with wonder. Eventually, Sandy tucks her children into bed, one by one. She kisses each of them goodnight, and tells them she loves them. Sandy then sits down by the fire to enjoy a few moments of peace before she, too, goes to bed. She gazes into the flames, lost in thought, until she finally falls asleep.

REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I sit in my hut surrounded by my five children. It's been a long day and I'm exhausted, but I know I have to stay up a little longer to make sure my little ones are all fed and tucked in for the night. I start a small fire in the center of the hut and begin to cook the evening meal. My children watch eagerly as the pot of stew begins to simmer. I ladle out bowls of steaming stew for my children and we all sit down to eat. As we eat, I tell my children stories about my own childhood in Africa. I talk about the animals I used to see and the adventures I used to have. My children listen raptly, their eyes wide with wonder. Eventually, I tuck my children into bed, one by one. I kiss each of them goodnight, and tell them I love them. I then sit down by the fire to enjoy a few moments of peace before I, too, go to bed. I gaze into the flames, lost in thought, until I finally fall asleep.
