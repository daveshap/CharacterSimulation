They were excited to see her and immediately started asking her about the fun activities they were going to do that night. Gabbi settled them down with some dinner while she finished getting things ready for the night. She had planned to do some baking with the kids and then let them watch a movie before bed. The kids were excited to help with the baking and they had a lot of fun decorating the cookies. After the cookies were done, they settled in to watch their movie.

I arrived at the cottage a little before six to babysit for the night. The kids - a boy and a girl, ages six and eight - were excited to see me and immediately started asking me about the fun activities we were going to do that night. I settled them down with some dinner while I finished getting things ready for the night. I had planned to do some baking with the kids and then let them watch a movie before bed. The kids were excited to help with the baking and we had a lot of fun decorating the cookies. After the cookies were done, we settled in to watch our movie. I sat with them and watched the movie, but I was also secretly keeping an eye on the time. I wanted to make sure the kids were in bed at a decent hour so their parents wouldn't have to worry about them. The movie ended and I helped the kids get ready for bed. I read them a story and then tucked them in. The kids gave me a big hug and told me they had a lot of fun. I said goodnight and then went to clean up the kitchen. I finished up my chores and then settled down to watch some TV myself. It was going to be a long night, but I was happy to be spending it with the two kids.
