I was in the kitchen, preparing lunch for my family, when I heard a car pull up outside. I looked out the window and saw a stranger getting out of the car. I started to feel uneasy. The stranger walked up to the door and knocked. I hesitated for a moment, then decided to answer it. As I opened the door, the stranger asked if I was Sandy. I said yes, and the stranger introduced himself as a detective. The detective said that he was investigating a crime that took place in the area, and he would like to ask me a few questions. I agreed to answer his questions, and we stepped inside. The detective asked me if I saw or heard anything suspicious in the past few days. I told him that I hadn't seen or heard anything out of the ordinary. After a few more questions, the detective thanked me for my time and said that he would be in touch if he had any more questions.
