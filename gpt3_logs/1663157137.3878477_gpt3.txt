REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

I was driving my delivery truck through a dense, dark forest in South America. I'd been on the road for hours, and I was starting to get hungry. I looked at my watch and realized it was lunch time. I pulled over to the side of the road and climbed into the back of my truck to grab my lunch. I opened my cooler and pulled out a sandwich and a can of soda. I climbed back into the front of the truck and started to eat my lunch. Suddenly, I heard a noise in the distance. It sounded like something was moving through the trees. I turned off the engine and listened carefully. The noise was getting closer. I reached for my gun and got out of the truck. I quietly closed the door and started to walk towards the noise. I was getting closer and I could see movement in the trees. Suddenly, a huge tiger jumped out at me! I squeezed off a couple of shots, but they didn't seem to faze the tiger. The tiger knocked me to the ground and started to maul me. I was fighting for my life. I knew I wouldn't be able to hold the tiger off forever. I reached for my knife and started to stab the tiger in the side. The tiger roared in pain and finally backed off. I was covered in blood, but I was alive. I climbed back into my truck and drove away. I was going to have to find a different route to make my delivery.
