SCENE: The sun is high in the sky, beating down on the savannah with a blazing heat. Swathi is out on a nature walk, enjoying the fresh air and incredible wildlife. She's been marveling at the lions and elephants all morning, and now she's stopped to take a break in the shade of a massive tree. Swathi is sitting on the ground, leaning against the tree trunk. She's taken off her shoes and socks, and is enjoying the feel of the grass on her feet. She's sipping from a bottle of water, and nibbling on a granola bar. She's feeling happy and relaxed, surrounded by the beauty of nature. Suddenly, she hears a loud rustling in the bushes nearby. Her heart starts to race as she wonders what kind of animal is coming towards her. Is it a dangerous predator? She slowly gets to her feet, ready to run if necessary.

She resumes her walk, feeling even more connected to this special place.
