As the sun begins to set, I calculate the day's receipts as I wait for the last customer to finish their coffee. The shop is brightly lit, and the air is filled with the smell of roasting beans. The customer finally leaves, and I begin to clean up. I wipe down the counters, restock the shelves, and sweep the floors. As I work, I think about the new coffee shop that opened up down the street. I'm not worried though. I know that my loyal customers will keep coming back.
