I wake up to the sun just peeking through the blinds, casting a warm glow around the room. My husband is still asleep beside me, snoring gently. I silently slip out of bed, careful not to wake him. I head to the bathroom to start my morning routine. I wash my face, brush my teeth, and put on my robe. Then I go to the kitchen to start breakfast. I put a pan on the stove and crack some eggs into it. While the eggs are cooking, I set the table and put a pot of coffee on. When everything is ready, I wake my husband and we sit down to eat breakfast together. After breakfast, I clean up the kitchen while my husband heads to the shower. Once he's gone, I take the opportunity to check my email and catch up on the news. After a few minutes, my husband comes out of the shower and gets dressed for the day. He gives me a kiss goodbye and heads out the door. I am now alone in the house. I take a moment to just relax and enjoy the quiet. Then I get up and start getting ready for my day.
