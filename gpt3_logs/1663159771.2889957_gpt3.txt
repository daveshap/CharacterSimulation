"I needed to talk to you," Sarah said. "It's about the test." Jenna groaned. She had completely forgotten about the test they were taking tomorrow. "I'm so sorry," she said. "I totally forgot." "It's okay," Sarah said. "I've been studying. I can help you." So they spent the next couple of hours studying together. By the time they were done, Jenna felt a lot better about the test.

I groaned. I had completely forgotten about the test we were taking tomorrow. "I'm so sorry," I said. "I totally forgot." "It's okay," Sarah said. "I've been studying. I can help you."
