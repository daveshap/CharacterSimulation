I'm walking down the street, pushing a stroller with a small child in it. The sun is shining and the sky is blue. I'm wearing a brightly colored sundress and sandals. I'm singing a nursery rhyme as I walk. The child in the stroller is giggling and clapping along with the rhythm of the song. As I walk, I pass by a group of teenage girls who are laughing and talking loudly. One of the girls notices me and the child and makes a face. I smile and say hello. The girl looks away and the group continues on their way. I continue down the street, now singing a new song. I pass by a man who is sitting on a bench, reading a newspaper. The man smiles at me and the child as we go by. I turn onto a side street and start to head back towards the child's home. I pass by a playground where several children are playing. I wave to the children and they wave back. I arrive at the child's home and rang the doorbell. The child's mother answers the door and thanks me for watching her child. I hand the mother the stroller and the child's mother gives me a kiss on the cheek. I say goodbye and start to walk back down the street.
