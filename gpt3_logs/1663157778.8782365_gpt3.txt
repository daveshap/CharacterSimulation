REWRITE AS FIRST PERSON:

==========

The alarm clock goes off, jolting me out of a deep sleep. I reach over and smack the snooze button before rolling out of bed. My feet hit the cold floor and I shiver as I make my way to the bathroom. I stare at myself in the mirror and let out a long sigh before starting the shower. The hot water feels good as I stand there, letting the sleep slowly drain out of my body. I think about the day ahead as I scrub myself clean. Another day on the construction site. I've been working there for months, and I'm starting to get pretty fed up with it. But I need the money, so I'll just have to suck it up and keep going. I step out of the shower and dry off before getting dressed. I give myself one last look in the mirror before heading out the door. I know it's going to be a long day.
