Rewrite the following scene into the main character's first person view.

SCENE: Jenna is lying in her bed, wide awake. It's the middle of the night, and she can't seem to fall asleep. She tosses and turns, trying to get comfortable, but it's no use. She looks over at the alarm clock and sighs. 3:00 AM. She's been trying to sleep for hours now, but her mind just won't shut off. She gets out of bed and goes to the window, looking out at the darkened street below. She wonders what it would be like to just walk out of her house and start exploring the world. She's never been very adventurous, but the thought of just leaving everything behind is strangely appealing. She watches as a car drives by, its headlights illuminating the road for a moment before disappearing into the night. Jenna wonders what it's like to be out there, driving around with nowhere to go. She longs for something more, but she doesn't know what that is. She feels trapped in her life, like she's stuck in a rut. She knows she needs to make a change, but she doesn't know how. She stares out the window for a while, lost in thought, before finally going back to bed.

==========

I'm lying in my bed, wide awake. It's the middle of the night, and I can't seem to fall asleep. I toss and turn, trying to get comfortable, but it's no use. I look over at the alarm clock and sigh. 3:00 AM. I've been trying to sleep for hours now, but my mind just won't shut off. I get out of bed and go to the window, looking out at the darkened street below. I wonder what it would be like to just walk out of my house and start exploring the world. I've never been very adventurous, but the thought of just leaving everything behind is strangely appealing. I watch as a car drives by, its headlights illuminating the road for a moment before disappearing into the night. I wonder what it's like to be out there, driving around with nowhere to go. I long for something more, but I don't know what that is. I feel trapped in my life, like I'm stuck in a rut. I know I need to make a change, but I don't know how. I stare out the window for a while, lost in thought, before finally going back to bed.
