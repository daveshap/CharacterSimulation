I'm walking through the dark forest, my heart hammering in my chest. I know I'm being followed, but I can't see who it is. Suddenly, a figure jumps out in front of me and I scream. The figure is wearing a mask and is holding a knife. I back away, but the figure advances on me, knives raised. I'm backed up against a tree and there's nowhere to go. The figure slashes at me with the knives and I feel pain as the blade sinks into my flesh. I sink to the ground, my vision blurring. The last thing I see is the figure coming towards me, knives raised for the kill.
