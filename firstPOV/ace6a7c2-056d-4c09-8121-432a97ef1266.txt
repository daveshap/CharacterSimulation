I'm standing behind the bar, wiping down the counter and stealing glances at the lone customer sitting at the other end. He's nursing a drink and staring out the window, lost in thought. I know I can't leave until he's finished his drink and gone, so I wait patiently. Finally, he stands up and walks over to me. He hands me a 100 credit chip and gives me a knowing look. I'm surprised and have no idea how much it's worth. He tells me, "You'll figure it out," before turning and walking out the door. I'm left standing there, staring at the chip in my hand, wondering what to do with it.
