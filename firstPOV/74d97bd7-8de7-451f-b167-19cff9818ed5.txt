I'm Mashawn, a construction worker working on the Eiffel Tower. I'm currently working on the second level, which is about half way up. I'm working on the construction of the frame for the level, and am using a welding machine to weld the metal bars together. The welder is turned on and is producing a bright light and a lot of noise. I'm wearing a welder's mask and am holding the welding torch in my hand. I'm wearing a construction workers hard hat, and am wearing a safety harness that is attached to the frame of the tower. I'm welding the metal bars together, and am taking a break to drink some water. I'm sweating profusely, and am wiping my brow with my sleeve. I'm wearing dirty overalls, and my hands are covered in soot. I take a drink of water from my bottle, and then go back to welding the metal bars together.
