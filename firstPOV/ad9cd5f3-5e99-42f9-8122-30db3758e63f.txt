I was sitting at my small, round table in my quaint country cottage, enjoying a simple lunch of bread and cheese. The sun was streaming in through the open windows, and a warm breeze was wafting through the room. All was peaceful and quiet. Suddenly, I heard a loud crash outside. I jumped up from my chair and ran to the window to see what was going on. I saw a large truck careening off the road and crashing into a tree just a few yards from my cottage. I rushed outside to see if I could help. I found the driver of the truck unconscious and bleeding badly. I quickly went back inside and called for an ambulance. While I was waiting, I did what I could to help the injured driver, using my first aid training to staunch the flow of blood and keep the man comfortable. Soon, the ambulance arrived and took the driver to the hospital. I was relieved that I was able to help, but shaken by the incident.
