I flop down onto my bed and let out a long sigh. I turn my head to the alarm clock on the nightstand and see that it's 6:00pm. With a groan, I push myself up and start to undress. I strip off my work clothes and toss them into the laundry hamper, then pull on a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt. I flop back down onto the bed, now fully dressed, and stare up at the ceiling. My mind begins to wander as I stare at the ceiling. I think about my job as a grocery store clerk and how much I hate it. I've been working there for four years and I'm still stuck in the same dead-end position. I'm just a 24-year-old man with no future and no prospects. My mind continues to race as I become more and more anxious. Suddenly, I sit up and swing my legs over the side of the bed. I can't take it anymore; I have to get out of the house. I grab my keys and wallet and head for the door.
