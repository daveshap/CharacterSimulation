I'm Wang, a delivery driver, and I'm making my way through the city at dusk. The city is brightly lit and there is a bustle of activity as people hurry to finish up their workday and get home for the evening. I weave my way through the crowds, making my way to my next delivery. I'm focused and determined to get the job done quickly so I can get home to my family.
