I'm in the middle of the mosh pit, surrounded by sweaty, half-naked bodies. I'm bouncing around, headbanging and singing along to the music, lost in the moment. Suddenly, I feel a tap on my shoulder. I turn around to see a young girl, no more than eight years old, standing there. The girl looks terrified. I realises I'm supposed to be babysitting this girl. I grab her hand and try to lead her out of the mosh pit, but the girl is too scared and won't move. I have no choice but to pick her up and carry her out of the crowd. As we make our way out, I can feel the girl shaking. I try to reassure her that everything is going to be alright, but I'm not sure if the girl understands. Finally, we make it out of the crowd and back to the girl's parents. The girl's mother scolds me for losing her daughter in the crowd, but the girl is just happy to be safe. I apologise and promise to be more careful in the future.
