I'm Sandy, a stay-at-home mom, and I'm currently in my husband's office building. It's evening time, and the building is mostly empty. I'm feeling a bit lost and confused, as I'm not used to being in such an environment. I'm slowly making my way down the hall, looking at the various doors and businesses that are located inside the building. I'm unsure of where I'm supposed to go or what I'm supposed to do. As I'm walking, I hear a noise coming from one of the offices. I slowly approach the door and peek inside. I see a man inside, pacing back and forth. It looks like he's on the phone and seems to be in the middle of a heated argument. I'm not sure what to do, so I just stand there and watch the man.
