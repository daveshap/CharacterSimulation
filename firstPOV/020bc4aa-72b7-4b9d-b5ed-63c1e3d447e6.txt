I was sitting on the porch, watching the kids play in the yard, when I heard a loud noise coming from the jungle. I jumped up, my heart racing, and saw a large, furry creature emerge from the bushes. It was a gorrila! I was paralyzed with fear, but the gorrila simply sat down next to me and started eating some bananas. The children, seeing that the gorrila was not going to hurt them, slowly approached it and started to pet it. I was still in shock, but I was slowly starting to relax. After a few minutes, the gorrila finished the bananas and then wandered back into the jungle. I watched it go, still in disbelief at what had just happened.
