I am a delivery driver who is currently under the Eifel Tower. I am in the middle of my shift, and I have been driving around for a few hours. I am currently stopped at a red light, and I am waiting for it to turn green so I can continue on my route. I am wearing a uniform and I have a hat on my head. I am also holding a package in my hand.
