I'm standing in the middle of the room, surrounded by people. I'm wearing a bartending uniform and I'm holding a tray of drinks. I'm smiling and I look happy to be here. The room is filled with the sound of music and people are cheering and clapping along with the beat. I feel happy to be a part of this.
