I'm standing on the beach, looking out at the ocean. It's a beautiful day, and the water is calm and peaceful. I'm surrounded by palm trees and the sand is warm and soft. I'm wearing a pair of shorts and a t-shirt, and I have a towel around my neck. I'm holding a cocktail in one hand. I've been working at the bar all day, and I'm ready to relax and enjoy the rest of my afternoon. I take a sip of my drink and then lean back against a palm tree, closing my eyes and letting the sun wash over me.
