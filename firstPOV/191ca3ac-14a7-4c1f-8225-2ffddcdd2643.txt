I'm sitting on the edge of a large construction site, eating my lunch. I'm surrounded by the sound of machinery and the hustle and bustle of workers. I'm wearing a hard hat and have a lunchbox by my side. I'm taking a break from the heat and the dusty conditions. I'm enjoying the break and the chance to eat something.
