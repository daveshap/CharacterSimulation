I've just arrived at the beach. It's early morning, and the sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon. The air is still and the water is calm. I start unloading my delivery of goods from the truck. I stack the crates of seafood onto a small cart, which I'll wheel down to the shoreline. As I work, I can hear the sound of waves crashing against the shore. I can also smell the salt in the air. I take a moment to appreciate the beauty of the scene before me. The colors of the sky and the water are simply stunning. I finish unloading the seafood and wheel the cart down to the water's edge. I begin to set up my stall, laying out a tablecloth and setting out the seafood. I know that the early morning customers will be coming soon, and I want to be ready.
