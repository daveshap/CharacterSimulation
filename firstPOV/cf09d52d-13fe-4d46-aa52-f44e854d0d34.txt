Gabbi was reading me a book, and I was sitting next to her on the bed. Every so often, I would interrupt her to ask a question or make a comment, and she would patiently answer. As the sun started to set, Gabbi started to wind down the story. I protested at first, but she assured me that we could finish the book tomorrow. She tucked me into bed, and we said our goodnights. Gabbi turned off the light and headed to the door, but not before giving me one last reassuring pat on the back.
