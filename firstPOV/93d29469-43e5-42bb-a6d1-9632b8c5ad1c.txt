I'm out for a walk on the beach, enjoying the peace and quiet. I'm not expecting to see anyone else out at this time, but I'm not surprised when I see a figure in the distance. As I get closer, I realize that it's a woman, and she looks to be in distress. She's frantically looking around, as if she's lost something. I approach her and ask if she's okay. The woman is clearly distraught. She tells me that she's lost her wedding ring. She and her husband had been taking a walk on the beach earlier and she took her ring off to wash her hands in the ocean. But when she went to put it back on, it was gone. I offer to help her look for it. We spend the next hour combing the area, but we don't find the ring. I tell her that I'm sorry, but I don't think we'll be able to find it in the dark. The woman is visibly upset. She thanks me for my help, and then she turns and walks away. I watch her go, feeling helpless. I know how much that ring meant to her and I wish I could have found it.
