I'm working on a project at my desk when I hear a noise outside my office door. It sounds like someone is trying to open it. I get up to investigate and find a security guard standing there. He tells me that there has been a report of an intruder in the building and he is there to investigate. I tell him that I have not seen anything, but the guard says he needs to check my office anyway. He enters and begins looking around. I stand there, watching him. After a few minutes, he's satisfied that there is no intruder and leaves. I go back to my desk and continue working on my project.
