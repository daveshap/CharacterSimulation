The sun is beating down on the savannah, sending waves of heat up from the parched earth. In the distance, I can see a herd of zebras grazing, their stripes providing little relief from the intense heat. Closer to me, a group of baboons are engaged in a spirited game of chase, leaping and bounding through the scrubby vegetation. I am sitting in the shade of an acacia tree, watching my two young children play. My toddler is busy digging in the sand, while my older child is chasing butterflies. Every now and then, my gaze wanders to the horizon, where I can see the hazy outline of mountains in the distance. It's another day in Africa, and I am content to while away the hours watching my children play and the wildlife go about their business.
