I was in my bedroom in the middle of the night. I was awake, but I was not moving. I was just lying in my bed, staring at the ceiling. I was thinking about my life and how things were going. I was not happy with how things were going. I felt like I was stuck in a rut. I was working a dead-end job at a grocery store and I didn't have any prospects for the future. I was in my early twenties and I felt like I had wasted my life so far. I was unsure of what to do next, but I knew that I needed to make a change.
