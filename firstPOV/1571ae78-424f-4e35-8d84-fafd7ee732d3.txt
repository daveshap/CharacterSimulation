The sun is setting and the sky is turning a deep shade of pink and orange. The birds are singing and the breeze is blowing through the trees. All is peaceful and tranquil. Suddenly, the sound of a car engine breaks the silence. My car pulls up to the cottage and I get out. I look around for a moment, taking in the peaceful surroundings, before making my way to the front door. I enter the cottage and am greeted by the smell of freshly baked bread. I follow the smell to the kitchen, where I find a warm loaf of bread waiting for me. I smile and take a bite, savoring the flavor. After a few minutes, I set the bread down and wander into the living room. I flop down onto the comfortable sofa and let out a sigh of contentment. It feels good to be home.
