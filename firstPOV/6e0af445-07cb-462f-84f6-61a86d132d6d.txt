I was in the middle of my lunch break, sitting at my desk in the office building where I worked. I was scrolling through my phone, when I heard a loud crash coming from the floor below. I got up to see what was going on and saw that a large chandelier had fallen from the ceiling and smashed onto the floor. People were screaming and running around in a panic. I quickly ran down the stairs to see if I could help. I saw that there were several people injured, and I started to help them to safety.
