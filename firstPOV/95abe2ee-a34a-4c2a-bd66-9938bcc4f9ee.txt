I'm walking down the street, carrying a small bag and my phone. I'm walking quickly and tapping on my phone. I turn a corner and almost bump into a woman who is walking with a stroller. The woman apologizes and I continue on my way. I come to a stop in front of a building and look up at the address. I check my phone again and then press the buzzer. A moment later, I am let into the building. I take the elevator up to the fifth floor and walk down the hall to apartment 5B. I knock on the door and a woman's voice can be heard from inside, telling me to come in. I enter the apartment and am greeted by a woman who is holding a baby. The woman thanks me for coming and hands me the baby. I begin to rock the baby and coo at it. The woman watchs for a moment and then goes into another room. I continue to rock the baby and talk to it softly. After a few minutes, the baby falls asleep. I gently lay the baby in its crib and then go into the kitchen to start dinner.
