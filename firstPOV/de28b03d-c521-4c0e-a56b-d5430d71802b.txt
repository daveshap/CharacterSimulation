As I walk down the street, returning home from my afternoon walk, I feel a sense of peace and happiness. The sun is setting and the city is starting to light up. I wave to a neighbor as I pass by, and I can hear the sound of laughter coming from a nearby park. As I approach my home, I notice that the lights are on and I can see my husband and children through the windows. I feel a surge of love and happiness as I walk up to the house and go inside.
