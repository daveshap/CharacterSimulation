I was babysitting for a family in a high-rise apartment building in the city. It was a beautiful day outside, and the family's children were playing in the park across the street. I was watching them from the window, making sure they were staying safe. Suddenly, my phone rang. It was the mother of the children I was babysitting. She sounded panicked and said she was on her way home, but she would be a little late. I said it was no problem and that I would watch the children until she got home. The mother sounded relieved and thanked me before hanging up. I went back to watching the children, but now I was a little more on edge. I wanted to make sure the children were safe until their mother got home.
