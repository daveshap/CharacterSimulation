I wake up slowly, the early morning light filtering in through my bedroom window. I rub my eyes and stretch, then swing my legs out of bed and stand up. I stretch again, yawning, then go over to my dresser and begin to get dressed for the day. I put on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt, then go over to my mirror to brush my hair. I tie it back into a ponytail, then go over to my bedroom door and open it, stepping out into the hallway.
