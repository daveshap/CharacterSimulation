The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon as I walk to work, carrying a bag of groceries. I look around at the beautiful scenery and marvel at how lucky I am to live in such a beautiful place. As I approach the grocery store, I can hear the sound of people talking and laughing inside. I smile to myself, knowing that I am about to start my shift. I walk inside and am greeted by my co-workers and customers. I put on my apron and get to work, helping the customers find what they need and bagging their groceries. The morning rushes by in a blur and before I know it, it is time for my lunch break. I sit down outside in the sun to eat my sandwich and drink my water. I people-watch as I eat, wondering what their stories are. I feel grateful for my job and for the simple things in life.
