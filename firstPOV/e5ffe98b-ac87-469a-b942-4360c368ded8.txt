I walk into the bar and take off my helmet. I can feel the sweat on my face, and I'm glad to be out of the suit. I walk up to the counter and the bartender greets me. I order a beer, and he serves me. I take a long drink, then sigh and look around the bar. I see a few people sitting at the counter, but mostly it's empty. I ask the bartender if there are any jobs available. He tells me that there are no open positions at the moment, but I persist and ask if there is anything I can do to help out around the bar. He hesitates for a moment, then decides to give me a chance. He tells me to stocking the shelves in the back. I nod and go to the back room.
