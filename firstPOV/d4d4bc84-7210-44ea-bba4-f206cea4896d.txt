I carefully step over the shining, wet sand as I make my way to the shoreline. The tide reaches my feet with an icy touch, quickly receding back and pulling the now wet sand beneath my feet with it. A sharp breeze cuts through the air, briefly stinging my skin before blowing my hair into my face. I squint through the darkness, trying to make out the figures of the other people on the beach. I can just make out their silhouettes against the light of the full moon. I wrap my arms around myself, trying to ward off the chill. I'm not used to the cold weather here, having just moved from my native country a few months ago. I miss the warmth of the sun on my skin and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. I take a deep breath, smelling the salt in the air and listening to the sound of the waves. Suddenly, I hear a noise behind me. I whips around, my heart pounding in my chest. I don't see anything, but I know I'm not alone. I starts to back away slowly, my feet sinking into the sand with each step. I trip over something and falls to the ground. I frantically looks around, trying to see what tripped me. And then I sees it. There's a body lying in the sand, just a few feet away from me. I scrambled to my feet, my heart racing. I slowly approaches the body, not knowing what to expect. I can see that it's a man, and he appears to be dead. There's a large wound on his chest, and his eyes are glassy and lifeless. I feels sick to my stomach. I've never seen a dead body before, and I don't know what to do. I look around, half-expecting to see the killer still lurking in the shadows. But there's no one there. I'm completely alone. I take a few deep breaths, trying to calm myself down. I knows I should go for help, but I'm too scared to move. I'm not sure what to do.
