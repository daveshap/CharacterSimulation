I lean against the railing, taking in the view of the city around me. The sunset casts a pink and orange glow over the skyline, and the twinkling lights of the tower are just starting to come on. I take a deep drag of my cigarette, exhaling a stream of smoke into the air. I smile to myself, feeling happy to be in such a beautiful place.
