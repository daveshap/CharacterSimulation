I was walking home from my daughter's soccer practice, carrying a bag of groceries. The streets were busy with rush-hour traffic and the sidewalks were crowded with pedestrians. I was thinking about what I needed to make for dinner tonight. As I approached my apartment building, I noticed a homeless man rummaging through a garbage can. He didn't seem to have noticed me yet. I felt a twinge of pity for the man, but I didn't want to get too close. Suddenly, the man looked up and made eye contact with me. He started to say something, but I quickly turned away and hurried into my building.
