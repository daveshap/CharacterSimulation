The darkness falls swiftly on the moon, and I the bartender am getting ready to close up shop. I've been busy all day serving space tourists and weary astronauts, and am looking forward to getting home to my family. The last few customers trickle out, leaving me alone in the bar. I tidy up, washing glasses and wiping down the counter. Finally, I lock the door and head home, looking up at the stars as I go.
