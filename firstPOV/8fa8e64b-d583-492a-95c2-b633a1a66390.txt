I'm walking through a dark forest in South America. I'm walking quickly, and my heart is pounding. I'm looking around nervously, as if I'm expecting something to jump out at me. I'm carrying a large bag over my shoulder, and I'm sweating profusely. I keep glancing over my shoulder, as if I'm being followed. Suddenly, I hear a branch snap. I freeze in my tracks and look around wildly. I see a large, dark shape moving towards me. I open my mouth to scream, but before I can make a sound, the dark shape is upon me.
