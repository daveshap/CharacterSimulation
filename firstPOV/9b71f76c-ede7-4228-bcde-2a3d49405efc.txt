I'm enjoying my lunch break on a mountaintop in Europe. The scenery is breathtaking and I'm surrounded by peace and quiet. I'm enjoying a meal of rice and vegetables when I hear a loud noise. It sounds like someone is coming up the mountain. I get up to see who it is and see a group of hikers struggling up the trail. They look exhausted and are covered in sweat. I wave to them and they wave back. I watch them for a few minutes before they disappear over the top of the mountain.
