I was driving my delivery truck through a dark forest in South America. I was tired and wanted to make my delivery so I could return to my hotel and rest. I was not familiar with the area and was having trouble seeing the road. Suddenly, I heard a noise in the forest and slowed down to investigate. I saw a large animal standing in the road. I did not know what it was and was afraid it would attack me. I slammed on the brakes and the truck skidded to a stop. The animal was a jaguar and it was about to attack me.
