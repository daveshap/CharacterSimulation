It's dusk, and the Eiffel Tower is aglow with the setting sun. I'm a delivery driver, and I'm making my rounds when I notice a group of teenagers gossiping and laughing near the base of the tower. I can't help but overhear their conversation; they're talking about a party that's happening tonight. I know that I can't go to the party - I have to work - but I can't help but feel a twinge of envy. I've never been to the Eiffel Tower before, and I can't help but wonder what it would be like to see the city at night from such a high vantage point. As I continue on my rounds, I can't help but keep stealing glances at the tower. Finally, when I'm finished for the night, I decide to take a closer look. I approach the group of teenagers and asks them for directions. The teenagers are a bit suspicious at first, but I'm friendly and persistent. Eventually, they give in and tell me how to get to the top of the tower. I thank them and set off. I take the elevator to the top, and the views are even more breathtaking than I could have imagined. I can see the whole city stretched out before me, and the lights are twinkling like stars. I feel like I'm on top of the world. It's an unforgettable experience, and I know that I'll never forget the night I spent under the Eiffel Tower.
