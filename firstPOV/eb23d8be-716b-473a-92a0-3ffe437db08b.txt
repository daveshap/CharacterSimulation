I was sitting at my desk, munching on a sandwich and scrolling through my phone, when I suddenly heard a knock on my bedroom door. I got up to answer it, and found my mom standing there. "Hey, baby. I just wanted to check and see if you're okay. You seemed a little down at breakfast this morning." "I'm fine, mom. Just a little bit tired, that's all." "Okay, well I just wanted to check. I love you." "Love you too, mom." I gave my mom a hug, and then mom headed back downstairs. I sat down at my desk again, and went back to scrolling through my phone.
