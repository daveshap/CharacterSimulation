I was in the middle of my shift when the power went out. Suddenly, the concert hall was plunged into darkness. I could hear the screams of the children I was babysitting echoing in the darkness. I quickly grabbed onto one of the children's hands and tried to calm them down. With the other hand, I reached into my pocket and pulled out my cell phone to use as a flashlight. I then led the children to the nearest exit.
