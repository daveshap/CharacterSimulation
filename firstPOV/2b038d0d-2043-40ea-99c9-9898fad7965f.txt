I was walking through the savanna, sweating profusely and feeling extremely hot. I was trying to find some shade, and I saw a large tree up ahead. I quickened my pace, but when I got closer, I realized that there was already someone there, sitting in the shade. I slowed down, not wanting to intrude. But as I got closer, I recognized the person as my old friend from high school, Sarah. I quickened my pace again, now eager to catch up with her. "Sarah! What are you doing here?" I asked as I approached. "Hi Jenna! I'm on a gap year, traveling before I start college," Sarah replied. We chatted for a while, catching up on what we'd been doing since we last saw each other. I told her about my plans to go to college next year, and she told me about her travels. We eventually stood up and said goodbye to each other, promising to keep in touch. I continued on my walk, now feeling much cooler thanks to the shade provided by the tree.
