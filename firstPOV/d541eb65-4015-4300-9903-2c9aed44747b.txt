I was walking home from my last job of the day when I heard a noise coming from the nearby forest. I was curious, so I decided to investigate. As I got closer, I could see a group of aliens gathered around a fire. They were laughing and joking and having a great time. I was about to turn and go home when one of the aliens spotted me. They all turned to look at me and I froze. Then, one of the aliens stepped forward and held out his hand. I hesitated for a moment, but then decided to take a chance. I reached out and took the alien's hand. He pulled me into the circle and they all started to dance. I laughed and danced along with them. It was the best night of my life.
