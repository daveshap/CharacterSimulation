I was at a concert in the early morning hours and I was surrounded by people who were drunk and disorderly. The music was loud and the atmosphere was wild. I wasn't having a good time. I was trying to make my way through the crowd, but people were bumping into me and spilling beer on me. I was getting angry and was about to leave when I saw a girl who was alone and seemed to be lost. I went over to her and asked if she was okay. She said she was lost and needed help. I took her by the hand and led her out of the crowd. I took her to my car and drove her home.
