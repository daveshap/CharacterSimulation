I'm driving my delivery truck through the city streets. I make a few turns and then stop at a red light. I look around and see the bright lights of the city all around me. I hear the sound of cars honking and people talking. The light turns green and I start to drive again. I make a few more turns and then arrive at my destination, a large delivery warehouse. I park the truck and get out. I go to the back of the truck and open the door. I start to unload the boxes of food that I have delivered.
