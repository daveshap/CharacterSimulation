I'm standing on the surface of the moon, next to a small grocery store. I've been working there all day, and I'm just about to finish my shift. The store is mostly empty, and it's been a slow day. I'm starting to get a little bit restless. I'm looking forward to going home and relax. Suddenly, the door to the store opens and a customer walks in. I greet the customer and ask if he needs any help. The customer doesn't respond, and just starts browsing the shelves. I'm a little bit confused, but I don't say anything. I just go back to my tasks. After a few minutes, the customer comes up to the counter with a few items. I ring him up and the customer pays. As I'm putting the change away, the customer speaks for the first time. "Thank you for your help," he says. "I'm just glad to finally be able to shop on the moon." I'm taken aback. I had no idea that the customer was from the moon. I thank the customer for his business and watch him leave. I've never seen a customer like that before, and I can't help but wonder what it's like to live on the moon.
