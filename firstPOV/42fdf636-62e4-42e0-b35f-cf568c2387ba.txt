The moon casts a pale light over the quiet beach. In the distance, the sound of waves crashing against the shore is soothing. I am Wang, a delivery driver. I have been working for the past few hours and am now on my way home. I am tired, but the thought of seeing my wife and children soon gives me strength. As I walk, I notice something shining in the sand. I bend down to pick it up, and realize it is a piece of jewelry. I wonder who it belongs to and how it ended up here. Suddenly, I hear someone calling my name. I turn around and see a woman running towards me. I recognize her as my neighbor, Mrs. Chen. She seems frantic and I wonder what could be wrong. Mrs. Chen tells me that her daughter is missing and she has been looking for her all night. She asks me if I have seen her. I know that the Chen family lives near the beach and I often see their daughter playing there. I tell Mrs. Chen that I have not seen her daughter tonight, but I will help her look for her. Together, we search the beach, but there is no sign of the little girl. I am about to give up when I hear a sound coming from the nearby bushes. I cautiously approach and see the little girl hiding there. Mrs. Chen is overjoyed to see her daughter safe and I am relieved that I was able to help. We both go home, tired but satisfied.
