The Eiffel Tower loomed overhead, its metal frame stark against the night sky. I huddled beneath it, my arms wrapped around myself for warmth. I was supposed to be babysitting the kids in the nearby apartment complex, but they had run off hours ago. Now, I was just trying to stay out of sight and stay warm until morning. I heard footsteps approaching and tensed up, but relaxed when I saw it was just a homeless man rummaging through a trash can. He didn't even look up at me as he shuffled off into the darkness. I shivered and tried to curl up into a tighter ball. I wasn't sure how much longer I could last out here. Maybe I should just go back to the apartment and face the music. But I was so cold, and I wasn't sure I could make it back up the stairs. I was just starting to drift off to sleep when I heard voices. I jolted awake and peered out from my hiding spot. A group of men were walking towards me, laughing and joking. They were obviously drunk. My heart raced as I tried to think of what to do. Should I try to run? But where would I go? They would easily catch me. I was about to start screaming for help when one of the men spotted me. "Well, well, well. What do we have here?" he called out, leering at me. I shrank back as the men approached. I was trapped.
