I come home from work exhausted, as usual. I walk into my bedroom and start taking my clothes off, eager to get into bed and relax. But then I notice something strange in the room. There's a faint noise coming from the corner. I slowly approach, trying to see what's making the noise. And then I see it. There's a small, furry creature hiding in the shadows. It's a rat, and it looks terrified. It's shaking and its eyes are wide, as if it's terrified of something. I've never seen a rat in my apartment before, and I'm not sure what to do. I stand there for a moment, unsure of what to do. Should I try to catch the rat? Should I call animal control? Or should I just ignore it and go to bed? After a moment of deliberation, I decide to just ignore the rat and go to bed. I get into bed and quickly fall asleep, exhausted from my long day. The rat is still hiding in the corner of the room, trembling in fear.
