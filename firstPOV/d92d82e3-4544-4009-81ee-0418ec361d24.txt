I'm just putting the chairs up on the tables and sweeping the floor, trying to finish my shift so I can go home and relax. I'm tired from a long day of work. But then I hear a noise from the back of the shop. I freeze and listen. I hear something moving around in the storage room. I know I should call the police, but I'm also curious to see what's going on. So I quietly set the broom down and grab a baseball bat from behind the counter. I creep to the back of the shop, bat in hand. I slowly open the door to the storage room and peer inside. I see a figure rummaging through the boxes. I raise the bat and prepare to swing.
