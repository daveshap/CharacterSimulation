I'm sitting at my desk, eating my lunch and scrolling through my Facebook feed. I see a post from my friend Sarah, who is also a stay-at-home mom. Sarah is sharing a picture of her kids with the caption "I'm so grateful for my beautiful children!" I feel a pang of jealousy, wishing I could trade places with Sarah. I close the Facebook app and go back to work.
