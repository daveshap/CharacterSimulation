I woke up to the sound of my alarm blaring, and it took me a few seconds to remember where I was. I Rubbed my eyes groggily as I sat up, looking around my small, cramped bedroom. The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow over the cityscape. I stretched my arms over my head with a yawn before getting out of bed and padding over to my window. I looked down at the busy street below, watching as people hurried to and fro. I could see the sidewalk cafe across the street, already starting to fill up with early morning commuters grabbing a quick cup of coffee before heading into the office. I could hear the hustle and bustle of the city as cars zoomed down the street and sirens wailed in the distance. I let out a sigh as I turned away from the window and went to get ready for school. I had a busy day ahead of me, and I knew I wouldn't have time to enjoy the peace and quiet of the morning for long.
