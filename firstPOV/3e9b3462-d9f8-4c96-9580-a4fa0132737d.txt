I had been walking for hours, and was now deep in the forest. I had been following a faint path, but it had long since disappeared. The light was fading fast, and I was starting to feel panic rising in me. I had no idea where I was, or how I was going to get out of the Forest. Suddenly, I heard a noise in the bushes ahead of me. I froze, straining to see in the dim light. Then, out of the shadows, a huge cat emerged. My heart raced as I watched the cat prowl towards me. The cat seemed to be stalking me, and I knew I was in serious trouble. I turned and ran the way I had come, but I had only gone a few steps when I heard the cat's deep, guttural growl behind me. I knew I was being hunted. The cat was getting closer and closer, and my fear was paralysing me. I was about to be killed, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.
