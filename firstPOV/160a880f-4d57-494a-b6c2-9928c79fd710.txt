The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon as I stand behind the register at the grocery store, yawning and stretching my arms. I've been working the overnight shift, and I'm just about ready to call it quits. As I'm waiting for the last few customers to finish up their shopping, my mind starts to wander. I think about my bed at home, and how good it's going to feel to finally get some rest. I'm just about to drift off into a daydream when I hear the front door of the store open. I snap to attention and greet the customer with a friendly smile. It's an older woman, and she's carrying a large bag of groceries. I start to ring her up, but my mind is still half-asleep. I make a few mistakes with the pricing, and the woman has to correct me. Finally, the last customer is finished and I can go home. I grab my coat from behind the register and head for the door. As I step outside, I'm greeted by a blast of cold air. I shiver and pull my coat tighter around myself. I start the long walk home, my mind already starting to drift off again. I'm so tired that I don't even notice the cold anymore. I'm just focused on getting home and getting into bed.
