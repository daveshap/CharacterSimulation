The sun beats down on me, the August heat bearing down on the land. The only respite from the heat is the shade of the acacia tree, where I sit with my friends, eating our midday meal. The beans and rice are a welcome relief from the heat, and we chat and laugh as we eat. I am the owner of the local coffee shop, and I take a moment to enjoy the company of my friends before getting back to work.
