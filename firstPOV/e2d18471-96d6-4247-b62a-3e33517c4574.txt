I'm walking up the mountaintop, enjoying the view of the valley below. I notice a small group of people in the distance and wonder if they're having a picnic. I start to make my way down the mountain to see if I can join in on the fun. As I get closer, I can see that it's a group of my classmates. They look like they're having a great time, laughing and joking with each other. One of the girls sees me and calls out to me. I'm so happy as I realize that I'm being invited to join them. I hurriedly make my way over and take a seat on the blanket. We chat and laugh together as we enjoy our lunch. I feel happy and grateful to be included in this special moment with my friends.
