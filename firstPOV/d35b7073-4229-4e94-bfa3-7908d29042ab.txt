I was in my office building, working on some homework, when I started to get tired. I decided to take a break and went to the window to look out. The office building was in the city, and I could see the lights of the skyline. The sun was setting, and the sky was a beautiful orange. I watched the people walking on the street below and the cars driving by. I felt a sudden jolt and realized that the building was shaking. I heard screams and people running. I grabbed my backpack and ran out of the office. The building was collapsing. I ran as fast as I could, but the debris was falling all around me. I was hit by a piece of concrete and knocked to the ground. I tried to get up, but I couldn't move. I was trapped.
