I'm leaning against the railing, taking a smoke break, when I hear a noise behind me. I turn around and see a woman walking towards me. She's wearing a long, flowing dress and has a scarf wrapped around her head. She looks lost. I ask her if she needs help, and she says she's looking for the nearest metro station. I tell her it's just over there and she thanks me. She starts to walk away, but then she stops and turns back to me. She asks me my name, and I tell her it's Tom. Then she asks me for my story. I hesitate at first, but then I start to tell her. I tell her about my hopes and my dreams and my fears. I tell her everything. When I'm finished, she looks at me with a satisfied smirk on her face. And then she tells me that she's going to kill me. I plead with her, I tell her I have a family. But she doesn't care. She tells me to strip, and I hesitate for a moment. But then I slowly start to remove my clothes. The woman watches me intently, a satisfied smirk on her face. I'm now completely naked. I try to cover myself up, but the woman just laughs. She tells me that it's time to begin, and I know there's no turning back now.
