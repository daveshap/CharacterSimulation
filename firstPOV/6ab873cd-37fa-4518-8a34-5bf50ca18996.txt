I'm walking under the Eiffel Tower at night, admiring the lit-up structure and thinking about how Paris is such a beautiful city. I'm headed to my coffee shop, which is nearby. As I walk, I'm thinking about how my business is doing and how I'm considering expanding. I'm also thinking about my personal life and whether or not I'm ready to settle down. I reach my shop and unlock the door, flipping on the lights. I get started on brewing a pot of coffee, thinking about how I'm looking forward to a quiet evening.
