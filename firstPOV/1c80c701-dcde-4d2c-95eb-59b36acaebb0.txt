Tonight's my last night on the moon. I've been living here for the past year, as part of a research project to study the effects of long-term isolation. But now it's time to go home. I've been feeling a bit homesick lately, and I'm excited to see my family and friends again. But I'm also a bit sad to leave this place that has been my home for so long. Tonight, I'm spending my last evening walking around the moonbase, saying goodbye to all the places and things that have been a part of my life here. I start at the landing pad, where I first arrived on the moon. I remember the excitement I felt when I first stepped out of the spaceship and saw the barren, grey landscape stretched out before me. I walk to the airlock and stare out at the stars for a while. I'm going to miss the quiet beauty of the night sky. Next, I go to the greenhouse, where I spent many hours working on my research project. I'm going to miss the peaceful atmosphere of this place. Finally, I go to my bedroom. I stare at my empty bed, remembering all the nights I spent here, reading or looking at pictures of my family and friends back on Earth. Tomorrow, I'll be back on Earth. But tonight, I take one last look around my home on the moon, saying goodbye to the place that has been my home for the past year.
