I was climbing to the top of the mountain, my construction tools slung over my shoulder. I'd been working on the new resort for weeks, and I'd finally reached the summit. The sun was just starting to set, and the view was breathtaking. I could see for miles in every direction, and the air was crisp and clean. I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment as I looked at the progress I and my team had made. Suddenly, I heard a noise behind me. I turned to see a large, furry creature standing on the edge of the cliff, watching me. My heart raced as I realized I was face-to-face with a bear. For a moment, the two of us just stared at each other. Then, the bear let out a loud roar and charged towards me. I didn't have time to think. I instinctively dropped my tools and ran for my life. The bear was right on my heels, but I managed to make it to safety just in time. I looked back at the bear, still standing on the edge of the cliff, and couldn't believe I'd just survived. That was a close call, I thought to myself, as I started the long climb back down the mountain.
