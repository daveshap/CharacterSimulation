I was walking through the dark forest in South America, looking for my lost child. I had been searching for hours and was getting tired. Suddenly, I heard a rustling in the bushes. I froze, afraid of what might be lurking in the shadows. However, I soon realized that it was only a small animal. I breathed a sigh of relief and continued on my way.
