I'm working the late-night shift at a concert venue. It's a busy night and the place is packed with people enjoying the music. I'm mixing drinks and serving customers at the bar. I've had a long shift, but I'm used to working late nights. The music is loud and the crowd is rowdy. I'm busy keeping up with the demand for drinks. I've been working non-stop for the past few hours, but I don't mind. I'm used to working long shifts and I enjoy being around people. Suddenly, the music stops and the lights come on. I look around and see that the concert is over. I start to clean up the bar, but I'm interrupted by a customer who asks for one last drink. I oblige and serve the customer. After the customer leaves, I finish cleaning up the bar and prepare to close for the night. It's been a long shift, but I don't mind. I'm used to working late nights and I enjoy being around people.
