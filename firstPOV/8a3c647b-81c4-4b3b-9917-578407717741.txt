The sun beats down mercilessly on the dusty plains of Africa, and I can feel every ounce of it. I'm trudging along, weighed down by a heavy load, and I know I still have a long way to go. I take a brief break to rest in the shade of a tree. I drink some water from my canteen and eat a little of the food I have with me. After a short rest, I begin walking again. I know I can't stop for long, as I have to make the delivery before nightfall. I pass through the village and head out into the wilderness again. As the sun begins to set, I finally arrive at my destination. I'm met by the village elder, who takes the package from me. I'm relieved to have made the delivery safely. I thank the elder and begin the long walk back to the village.
