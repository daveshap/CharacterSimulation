I'm sitting in an office building, waiting for my after-school job to start. I'm wearing a button-down shirt and khakis, and I look a bit out of place among the sea of suits. I'm tapping my foot impatiently, and I keep checking my phone. Every few minutes, I stand up and pace around the room. Finally, at 6pm, my boss arrives.
