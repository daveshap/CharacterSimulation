I was up on the mountaintop, enjoying the view, when I heard a noise behind me. I turned to see a group of goats coming up the mountain, followed by a woman who was herding them. I greeted the woman and we started chatting. She told me that she'd been herding goats for years, and that it was a tough but rewarding job. She asked me what I did, and I told her that I was a grocery store clerk. The woman was interested in hearing about my job, and we chatted for a while before she had to go back to her goats. I waved goodbye and went back to my lunch.
