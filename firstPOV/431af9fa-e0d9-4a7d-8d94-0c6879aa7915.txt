I was enjoying my lunch break on a beautiful mountaintop in Europe when I heard a noise behind me. I turned around to see a large, furry creature lumbering towards me. It was a bear! I knew I needed to stay calm, so I slowly backed away from the bear. The bear didn't seem to be interested in me and soon wandered off into the woods. I was relieved but also a little shaken. I knew I was lucky that I wasn't hurt, but I'll never forget my close encounter with a real live bear!
