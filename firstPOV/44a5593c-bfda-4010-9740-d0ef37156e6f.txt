The sun is beginning to set over the African plains, casting a beautiful orange hue in the sky. The temperature is beginning to cool down, making it the perfect time to enjoy a drink. I'm busy mixing drinks for the guests. I hum to myself as I work, lost in my own world. The lodge is full of people chatting and laughing, enjoying the peace of the wilderness. The air is thick with the smell of alcohol and perfume. As the night goes on, I get more and more busy. I chat and joke with the guests, serving them drink after drink. The atmosphere is electric and everyone is having a great time. I'm in my element, making sure everyone has a good time. Eventually, the lodge starts to quiet down as people head to bed. I finish up my shift and head to my own room, tired but happy.
