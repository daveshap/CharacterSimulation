I'm standing behind the bar, serving drinks to the guests. The atmosphere is electric, with the music pulsing through the air and the crowd cheering. I'm busy keeping up with the demand for drinks, but I can't help but stop and watch the show. The performers on stage are giving it their all, and the audience is loving it. I can't help but smile as I watch the show and serve the guests.
