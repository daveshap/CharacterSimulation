I'm driving my truck through the darkness, my headlights cutting through the night. I'm delivering a shipment of supplies to a remote village in Africa, and I know I have to be careful. There are often bandits on these roads, looking to steal whatever they can. I keep my hand on the steering wheel, my eyes scanning the road ahead. I'm getting close to my destination, but I don't let my guard down. Suddenly, I see movement in the bushes by the side of the road. I slow down, my heart racing. I know I shouldn't stop, but I can't just leave someone stranded in the middle of the night. I hesitate for a moment, then decide to stop. I cautiously get out of the truck, my hand on my gun. I approach the bushes, and a man jumps out at me, brandishing a knife. I jump back, my heart pounding. I draw my gun and fire, hitting the man in the chest. The man falls to the ground, dead. I stand there for a moment, my hand shaking. I know I had no choice, but killing someone is never easy. I take a deep breath and get back in the truck, driving the rest of the way to my destination.
