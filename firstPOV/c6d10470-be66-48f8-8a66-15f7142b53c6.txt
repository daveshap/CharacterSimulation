I'm wiping glasses at the bar when the door opens and a woman walks in. She's wearing a bright dress, and her hair is pulled back in a tight bun. She looks around the bar, and when she sees me, she walks over. "Hello," she says. "I'm looking for someone." I nod and point to a man sitting at a table in the corner. The woman thanks me and walks over to the man. They exchange a few words, and then the woman sits down. The man looks up at me and nods, and I come over with a bottle of whiskey. I pour a glass for the man, and then go back to wiping glasses. The woman and the man talk for a while, and then the man gets up to leave. He drops some money on the table, and the woman stands up. They exchange a few more words, and then the man walks out the door. The woman stays for a few more minutes, finishing her drink. I watch her as she sits there, lost in thought. Then she gets up and leaves, without saying a word.
