I've been walking for hours, and my feet are starting to ache. I'm not sure if I'm going in the right direction, but I know I need to find help soon. Suddenly, I hear a rustling in the bushes ahead of me. I freeze, listening intently. It could be an animal, or it could be someone waiting to ambush me. I carefully reach into my pocket and grip my knife tightly, just in case. The rustling gets closer, and I can see a figure moving towards me through the darkness. I relax slightly when I realize it's just a small monkey. The monkey climbs up my leg and onto my shoulder, chattering away excitedly. I continue walking, now with the monkey as my companion. I'm not sure what I'm going to find in the depths of the forest, but I know I need to keep moving.
