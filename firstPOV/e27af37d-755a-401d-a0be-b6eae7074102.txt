I'm walking through the field, my feet sinking into the soft, spongy ground with each step. I'm on my way home from school, and I can't wait to get there. I've been walking for a while, and I'm starting to get tired. I'm just about to give up and sit down for a rest when I notice something in the distance. At first I can't believe my eyes, but as I get closer I can see that it's a group of elephants! I've never seen elephants in the wild before, and I'm amazed. They're so big and majestic! I watch them for a while, until I realize that it's getting dark and I need to get home. As I walk away, I can't help but feel grateful for this special moment that I've just experienced.
