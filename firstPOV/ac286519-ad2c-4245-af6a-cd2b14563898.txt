I'm at the concert, standing in the middle of the crowd with a box of pizza. I'm looking around, trying to figure out where I'm supposed to deliver it, when someone bumps into me from behind and the pizza goes flying. I turn around to see a guy stumbling away, laughing. He's obviously drunk. I'm angry, but there's nothing I can do. I turn back to the pizza, which is now lying in the dirt. I sigh and bend down to pick it up. That's when I notice a girl standing off to the side, watching me. She's got a kind smile on her face. I feel a little embarrassed, but I smile back at her. Then I turn and head back to my truck, pizza in hand.
