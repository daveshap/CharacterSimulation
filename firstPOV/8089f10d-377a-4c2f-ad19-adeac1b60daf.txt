I take in the pink and orange glow of the setting sun behind the mountains, and I can't help but feel a sense of peace. I've been hiking all day, and this break is well-deserved. The air is cool and crisp, and I can see my breath in the air. I take a deep breath and feel the exhaustion of the day start to seep out of my muscles. I look down at the valley and watch as the lights start to come on in the buildings below. I can see a few people walking around, and the sound of laughter carries up to me on the breeze. I look up at the stars, and I'm filled with a sense of love and appreciation for this moment. I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than right here, right now.
