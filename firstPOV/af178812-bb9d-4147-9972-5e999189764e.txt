I'm making my rounds at the office building, dropping off packages and picking up outgoing mail. I've been working this route for a few years, so I know all the employees by name. As I'm heading to the mail room, I see Ms. Nguyen coming out of her office. She gives me a friendly wave and I return the gesture. Then I enter the mail room and start sorting through the mail.
