I'm Wang, a delivery driver, and I've been making deliveries for years. I know the layout of this office building like the back of my hand. I'm just about to make my final delivery of the night when I hear a strange noise coming from one of the offices. I approach the door cautiously and peer inside. It's dark, but I can see a figure moving around in the shadows. I'm about to call out when I hear a crash from inside the office. I decide to take action. I kick open the door and rush inside, but it's too late. The intruder has already made off with the company's sensitive information. I'm a hero, but the company is going to have to deal with the fallout from the data breach.
