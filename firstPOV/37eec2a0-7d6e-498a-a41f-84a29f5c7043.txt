I was working the afternoon shift at the grocery store when I noticed a commotion outside. I could see a large crowd of people gathering in the street and it looked like they were getting agitated. I started to feel uneasy and decided to go and see what was going on. As I approached the crowd, I could see that they were shouting and jeering at a group of men who were trying to cross the street. The men were obviously from a different country and they were not welcome here. The crowd started to push and shove the men, and I could see that they were in danger. I tried to help them, but the crowd was too violent and I was forced to watch as the men were beaten and chased away. I was shaken by what I had witnessed and I couldn't help but feel guilty that I was unable to do more to help.
