I was enjoying a hike on a mountaintop in Europe when I heard a loud noise. I looked up and saw a massive avalanche coming towards me. I jumped off the boulder and took cover behind a tree just in time. I was terrified as I watched the snow and debris come thundering down around me. I was relieved when it finally stopped and I was able to assess the damage. Thankfully, I was unharmed but my heart was pounding from the near-miss.
