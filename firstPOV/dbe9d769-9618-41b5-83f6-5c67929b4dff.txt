I walk out of the store and into the office building where my shift ended. I take the elevator up to my floor. As I exit the elevator, I see my boss's office. The door is open and the lights are on. I know my boss is still there, working late. I decide to go say hi. I walk up to the office and peek in. My boss is sitting at his desk, working on some papers. I clear my throat to get his boss's attention. My boss looks up and sees me. He invites me in and we start talking. We talk about my shift and how I'm doing. We also talk about the grocery store and how business is going. After a few minutes, my boss thanks me for coming in and tells me to go home. I say goodbye and head home.
