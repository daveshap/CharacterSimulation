I'm hard at work, hammering away at some steel beams. The sun is setting, casting a beautiful orange hue over the sky. The Eiffel Tower looms large in the background, its lights just beginning to twinkle in the dusk. I'm sweating, my muscles straining with the effort. I pause for a moment to wipe the sweat from my brow, before going back to work. The sound of my hammer ringing out against the steel is drowned out by the sound of a car horn honking. I look up to see a group of tourists getting out of a taxi, eager to take some photos under the tower. I shake my head and go back to work, as the tourists snap away. The sky turns dark, and the lights of the Eiffel Tower come to life. They twinkle and glow, lighting up the night sky. I put down my hammer and admire the view for a moment, before packing up my things and heading home.
