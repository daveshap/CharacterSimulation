I was hiking when I saw a small cabin in a clearing on a mountaintop. I knocked on the door, but there was no answer, so I tried the handle and found that it was unlocked. I stepped inside and looked around. The cabin was small and cozy, with a fireplace in one corner and a bed in the other. There was a table in the middle of the room, and I decided to make myself at home and started a fire in the fireplace. I was just starting to feel warm when I heard a noise outside. I got up to investigate and saw a group of people walking towards the cabin. They looked like they were carrying supplies and camping gear. I went back inside and hid under the bed. I was terrified of what might happen if they found me. I could hear them coming into the cabin, and I held my breath, hoping they wouldn't find me.
