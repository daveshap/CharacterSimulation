I'm driving my delivery truck through the city streets. It's the middle of the night, but the city is still brightly lit. I'm thinking about my family back home in China. I miss them dearly, but I know that I must continue working to support them. As I drive, I notice a woman walking along the side of the road. She looks tired and dirty, as if she has been walking for a long time. I slow down and ask the woman if she needs help. The woman says that she is looking for a place to stay for the night. I tell her that she can stay in my truck. The woman is grateful and climbs into the passenger seat. I drive the woman to a nearby hotel and help her get a room for the night. The woman thanks me and tells me that I am a good man. I simply nod and drive away.
