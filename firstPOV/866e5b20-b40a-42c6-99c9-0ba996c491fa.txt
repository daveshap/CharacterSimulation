I'm standing in the middle of a huge concert hall, surrounded by people milling about and chatting. I'm wearing a hard hat and construction boots, and I look a bit out of place. I'm holding a lunch box in one hand and a thermos in the other. I take a sip from my thermos and look around, taking in the sights and sounds of the concert hall. I've never been to a place like this before, and I'm impressed by the size and scale of the place. I see people dressed up in fancy clothes, sipping champagne and nibbling on canaps. I notice a few security guards posted around the perimeter of the room, and I wonder what they're there for. Suddenly, I feel someone bump into me from behind. I spin around to see a tall, blonde woman stumbling backwards, her face red with embarrassment. She mutters an apology and scurries away. I shake my head and turn back to the concert hall. I can hear the faint sound of music drifting through the air, and I wonder what it would be like to hear it up close. I finish my drink and put my thermos back into my lunch box. Then I head over to the nearest security guard and ask if I can go inside. The guard looks me up and down and then nods. I thank him and hurry inside. I find a seat near the front of the hall and just look around, marveling at the beauty of the place. I can feel the beat of the music pulsing through my body, and I can see the dancers onstage, whirling and spinning in time to the music. I'm entranced by the whole experience, and I don't want it to end. But eventually, the concert does come to an end, and the crowd starts to filter out. I stay in my seat for a few moments longer, just soaking it all in. Then I get up and head back outside, a huge smile on my face.
