I was tending bar at a small roadside inn in Africa when the men came in. I could tell immediately that they weren't here for a friendly drink. They started demanding money and valuables from the patrons. I tried to stay calm, but I was terrified. I knew that if I did anything to provoke them, they could easily kill me and the other innocent people in the bar. The men were getting agitated, and I could see that they were about to start looting the place. I knew I had to act fast. I reached under the bar and grabbed a shotgun. I pointed it at the men and ordered them to leave. The men laughed at me, but they could see the resolve in my eyes. They knew I wasn't afraid to use the shotgun if necessary. The men slowly backed out of the bar, still laughing. But I knew that this wasn't over. I knew they'd be back.
