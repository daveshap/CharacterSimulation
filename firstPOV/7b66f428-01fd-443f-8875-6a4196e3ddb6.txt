I enter my cottage in the country and take a deep breath of the fresh air. I feel a sense of calm wash over me as I listen to the rustling of leaves in the gentle breeze. Inside, the cottage is cozy and warm. A fire is crackling in the fireplace and a pot of tea is steeping on the stove. I take off my shoes and settle down on the couch with a contented sigh. I pick up my laptop and begin to work, but after a few minutes I find myself daydreaming about the weekend. I'm looking forward to taking a long walk in the woods and breathing in the crisp autumn air. Maybe I'll even find a few mushrooms to add to my tea!
