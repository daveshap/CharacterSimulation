I'm Aleksy, a grocery store clerk in a small town in Africa. It's 6pm and the sun is setting. I'm getting ready to close up the store for the night. I'm sweeping the floor and putting the food away. I'm thinking about my family and how I miss them. I'm also thinking about the war that is going on in my country. I'm worried about my friends and family who are fighting in the war. I'm also worried about the civilians who are caught in the middle of the fighting.
