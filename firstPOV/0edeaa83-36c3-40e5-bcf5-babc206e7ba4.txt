I'm sitting at my desk, tapping my fingers against the surface as I look around the office. It's a typical day at work, and I'm getting a little bit bored. I've been working as a grocery store clerk for the past year, and I'm starting to feel like I'm in a rut. Suddenly, the door to my office opens and my boss walks in. I sit up straighter in my chair, trying to look attentive. My boss begins to speak, and my mind starts to wander. I don't really care what my boss is saying, and I tune out the words. Suddenly, I hear my name. My boss is asking me a question, and I have no idea what the answer is. I stutter for a moment, trying to come up with something, but my mind is blank. My boss looks annoyed, and I know I'm in for a scolding.
