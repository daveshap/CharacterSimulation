I was in the middle of a concert, surrounded by people of all ages. I was enjoying the music, tapping my foot along to the beat. The sun was shining and the atmosphere was festive. Suddenly, my cell phone rang. I looked down at the screen and saw that it was my coffee shop. I hesitated for a moment, but then decided to answer. "Hello? Yes, this is Bob. What can I do for you?" I listened for a moment, a look of concern spreading across my face. "Oh no, that's not good. I'll be right there." I hung up the phone and started to make my way through the crowd, apologizing as I bumped into people. I was obviously in a hurry, and people were starting to notice. "Excuse me, excuse me. I'm sorry, I have to go." I finally made it to the edge of the crowd and started to run. I was obviously worried about something.
