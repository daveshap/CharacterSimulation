The sun is beating down on me mercilessly. I'm standing in the middle of a dusty road, looking around me in confusion. I have no idea where I am or how I got here. I'm sweating profusely and my heart is pounding in my chest. I look around me again, desperately trying to orient myself, but there is nothing to see except for flat, featureless land in every direction. I take a few stumbling steps forward, then collapse to my knees, overcome with exhaustion and fear.
