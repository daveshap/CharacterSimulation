I hop out of bed and stretch, taking a deep breath of the cold morning air. I slide my feet into my slippers and head downstairs to start a pot of coffee. I put on a cozy sweater and start a fire in the fireplace. The dog follows me around, wagging her tail. I put a pan of water on the stove to boil some eggs, and set the table. The sun starts to peek over the horizon, and the birds start chirping. The coffee is ready, and I sit down to enjoy a quiet breakfast by the fire.
