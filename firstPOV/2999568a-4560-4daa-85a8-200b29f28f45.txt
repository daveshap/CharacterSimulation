I'm Mashawn, a construction worker, and I'm working on a building project on the moon. It's mid-afternoon and the sun is shining brightly. I'm wearing a space suit and I'm using a construction tool to build the structure. The project is almost completed and I'm beginning to feel tired. However, I know that I need to finish the job before I can take a break.
