I'm bartending at the Lunar Lounge tonight, and it's been pretty quiet. I'm just wiping down the bar when I see Jack walk in. He's a regular here, so I know him pretty well. "Hey, Jack. What can I get you tonight?" "Just a whiskey, Tom. neat." I pour him a glass of whiskey and slide it across the bar. He looks like he's seen a ghost. "You look like you've seen a ghost, Jack. What's up?" "I just saw something out on the plains. Something...unnatural." "What do you mean?" "I don't know. I can't explain it. But it was definitely something not of this world." I lean in, interested in what he has to say. "What did it look like?" "I don't know. It was dark, and I couldn't see it clearly. But it was big. And it was moving fast." "Did it see you?" "I don't know. I don't think so. I'm not sure." "What did you do?" "I turned and ran the other way. I didn't want to stick around to find out what it was." I nod my head, understanding. "I don't blame you, Jack. But whatever it was, it's not your fault. These things happen." "I know. But I can't help but feel like it's my fault. Like I shouldn't have been there." "Don't blame yourself, Jack. There's nothing you could have done." I pour him another drink, and the two of us sit in silence, contemplating what he saw.
