I'm walking through the forest in South America, carrying a large bag over my shoulder. It's difficult to see in the darkness, and I'm careful to avoid the trees and roots that can trip me up. I'm looking for a specific spot in the forest, and I know that it's getting close. Suddenly, I hear a noise behind me, and I turn around to see a large, furry creature standing there, watching me. My heart races, and I start to back away slowly. The creature begins to move closer to me, and I realize that it's a jaguar. I know that I'm in danger, and I start to run. The jaguar is faster than me, and it soon catches up to me. I feel its teeth sinking into my flesh, and I know that I'm going to die. I feel the jaguar dragging me into the darkness, and then everything goes black.
