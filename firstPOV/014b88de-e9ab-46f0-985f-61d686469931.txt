I had been working long hours at the construction site and was exhausted. I had just finished my shift and was looking forward to getting some rest. I entered my bedroom and was about to lie down on my bed when I heard a noise coming from the other side of the room. I froze and listened carefully, trying to determine what it was. It sounded like someone was moving around in the room. I slowly got up from the bed and quietly walked across the room, careful not to make any noise. I reached the door and slowly moved my hand towards the doorknob, heart racing as I prepared to confront the intruder. I turned the knob and swung the door open, ready to confront whoever was inside. However, the room was empty. There was no one there. I looked around the room, confused and trying to figure out what was going on. Then I heard the noise again, coming from the closet. I walked towards the closet and opened the door. Inside, I found a small creature moving around. It was a mouse! I sighed in relief and laughed at myself for being so scared. I reached down and scooped the mouse up into my hand, taking it outside to release it into the night.
