I'm sitting on the moon, eating my lunch and enjoying the view. I've been babysitting for the past few hours and I'm ready to take a break. It's a beautiful day on the moon, and I'm surrounded by the bright, white landscape. I can see the Earth in the distance, and it looks so peaceful. I'm happy to be able to sit and relax for a few minutes before I have to go back to work.
