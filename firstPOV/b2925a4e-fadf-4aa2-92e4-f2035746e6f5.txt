As I'm wiping down the bar and straightening up bottles, I notice a figure walking down the street. The figure is poorly lit and I can't quite make out who it is. As the figure gets closer, I can see that it's a woman. She looks to be in her early twenties and is wearing a short, form-fitting dress. She has long, dark hair that cascades down her back. She looks lost and confused. I wonder if I should say something to her.
