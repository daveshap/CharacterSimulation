The sun is setting and casting a red glow over the dense forest. I am walking along a narrow path, my feet sinking into the soft, spongy earth beneath me. I am sweating profusely and my heart is pounding in my chest. I know I am being followed, and I am terrified. Suddenly, I hear a twig snap behind me. I whirl around, my heart in my throat. There is nothing there. I stand there for a moment, panting, before continuing on my way. I come to a clearing and breathe a sigh of relief. But my relief is short-lived, as I hear something moving in the bushes. I freeze, my heart pounding. Suddenly, a figure springs out from the bushes and grabs me. I scream, as I am dragged away into the darkness.
