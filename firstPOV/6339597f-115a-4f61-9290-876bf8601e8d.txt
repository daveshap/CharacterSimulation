I stand on the mountaintop, my breath coming in short gasps in the cold night air. I look around, taking in the view of the distant valley below, the sparkling lights of the town in the distance. A feeling of peace and contentment fills me. I turn and begin to walk back down the mountain path, my feet sinking into the soft, powdery snow. I know I should be getting back home, but I can't help but pause to take in the beauty of the night around me. Suddenly, I hear a noise behind me and turn to see a large, shaggy creature standing just a few feet away, watching me with bright, intelligent eyes. My heart quickens in fear, but I hold my ground, knowing that I'm not doing anything wrong. The creature takes a step forward, and I take a step back. We stand there for a moment, staring at each other, before the creature finally turns and lopes off into the darkness. I watch it go, my heart still pounding in my chest, before I finally turn and continue on my way down the mountain.
