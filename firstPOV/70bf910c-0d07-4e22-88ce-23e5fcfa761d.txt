I finish my last night shift for the week and I'm eagerly looking forward to my weekend. It's a slow night, so I've had plenty of time to catch up on my schoolwork and I'm almost finished my shift. Suddenly, I hear a noise coming from one of the other rooms in the office building. I try to ignore it, but it's getting louder and more persistent. I'm pretty sure that there's someone in the building and they're trying to break in. I start to feel a little scared, but I know I need to find out what's going on. I cautiously approach the source of the noise and peek around the corner. I see a man trying to pry open the door to the office building. The man sees me and starts to run towards me. I scream and run the other way. I know I need to find somewhere to hide. I run into one of the offices and lock the door behind me. I can hear the man trying to open the door, but thankfully it holds. I call the police and wait for them to arrive. I'm shaken, but relief washes over me when I see the police pulling up to the office building.
