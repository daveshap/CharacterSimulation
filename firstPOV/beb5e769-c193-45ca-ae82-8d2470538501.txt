The sun is setting on the mountaintop, and the sky is ablaze with oranges and pinks. The temperature is cool and the air is fresh. I'm standing behind the bar, preparing drinks for the evening rush. I'm wearing a white shirt and black pants. My hair is neatly combed and my beard is trimmed. I look like I'm in my early 30s. The bar is made of dark wood, and the shelves are lined with bottles of liquor. There is a chalkboard on the wall, with the day's specials listed. The bar stools are upholstered in red leather. The door to the bar opens and a group of people come in, laughing and talking. They take a seat at the bar and I greet them warmly. I ask them what they would like to drink and start preparing their orders. The bar is soon full of people, and the atmosphere is convivial. I'm kept busy mixing drinks and serving them to the customers. I chat with the people at the bar, getting to know them and making them feel welcome. As the evening wears on, the bar starts to clears out. I finish up my shift and clean the bar, making sure everything is in its place. I bid farewell to the remaining customers and lock the door behind me. I've had a busy evening, but I'm happy. I love my job and the people I meet. I feel lucky to be working in such a beautiful setting. As I walk down the mountain, I look forward to coming back tomorrow night and doing it all over again.
