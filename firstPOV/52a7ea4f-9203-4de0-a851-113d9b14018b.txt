I walk down the street, my mind racing with coding problems I've been trying to solve all day. I'm eager to get home and relax, but first I have to stop at the grocery store. The city is alive with energy and I feel a familiar thrill as I step into the familiar hustle and bustle. I weave my way through the crowd, dodging people and bags as I make my way to the store. Inside, I grab a basket and start down the aisle, my mind still on my work. I absently throw items into my basket, not really paying attention to what I'm doing. I'm so lost in thought that I don't even notice when I bump into someone. "Sorry!" I exclaim, finally snapping out of my thoughts. I look up to see a handsome stranger standing there, a slight smile on his face. For a moment, we just stand there, looking at each other. Then, with a small nod, the stranger moves on and I do the same. I finish my shopping in a daze, my mind still racing.
