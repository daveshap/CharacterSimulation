I'm taking a break from my deliveries to enjoy a cup of tea in my peaceful country cottage. I've been driving for hours, and the break is welcomed. The cottage is nestled in a clearing among tall trees, and a stream flows nearby. The air is fresh and clean, and the sun is shining. I take a deep breath and relax into my chair, savoring the quiet peace of my surroundings. Suddenly, I hear a branch snap. Startled, I look around, but there's no one there. I grab my walking stick and stand up, ready to defend myself if necessary. But the only thing I see is a deer, standing calmly in the clearing and looking at me. I relax and laugh to myself. Then I go back to my chair and enjoy the rest of my break in the quiet countryside.
