I had been driving my scooter along the beach all morning, making deliveries for the local businesses. It was now lunch time, and I was hungry. I decided to take a break and sit down on the beach to eat my lunch. I sat down on the sand and began to eat my rice and vegetable dish. I looked out at the water and saw the waves crashing against the shore. I watched as the seagulls flew overhead, looking for food. It was a peaceful scene. After I finished my lunch, I lay back on the sand and dozed off. I was content, surrounded by the sounds of the waves and the smell of the sea.
