The moon is a beautiful, serene place. The sky is a deep, rich blue, and the stars shine bright. The air is still and cool. I am a babysitter who is watching over a group of children. They are all playing together happily, running and chasing each other around. I am keeping a close eye on them, making sure they stay safe. As dusk starts to fall, the children begin to get tired. I gather them all up and lead them back to their home. They say goodbye to the moon and the stars, and I tuck them all into bed. It's been a long day, but I am happy to have spent it with the children. They are all so sweet and innocent. I know they will have many more adventures together, on the moon and beyond.
