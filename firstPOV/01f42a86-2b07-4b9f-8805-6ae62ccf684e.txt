The sun is just peeking over the horizon, and the early morning light is spilling over the city. The streets are already busy with people heading to work or running errands. I'm behind the bar, getting things set up for the day. I've got the radio playing softly in the background and I'm humming along as I clean glasses and set out bottles of liquor. I'm looking forward to a busy day at the bar.
