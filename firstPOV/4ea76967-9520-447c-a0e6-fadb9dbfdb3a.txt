I love watching the sunrise over the ocean. There's something about the peace and quiet of nature that really makes me feel at ease. I had come to this beach early this morning because I wanted to watch the sun come up. I had always been drawn to the ocean and I loved the feeling of being in nature. As I watched the sky change color, I felt my own body change. I felt my muscles relax and my mind clear. For a few minutes, I forgot about everything else in the world and I just existed in this moment. And in that moment, I felt complete.
