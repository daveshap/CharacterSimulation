I've been driving for hours, and I'm starting to feel fatigued. But I know I have to press on - I have an important delivery to make. As I near the top of the mountain, the road becomes even more treacherous. I have to concentrate hard to keep the truck from slipping off the edge. Finally, I reach my destination. A large, imposing castle perched atop the mountain. I have to ring a bell to announce my arrival, and then I'm met by a butler who leads me inside. I'm led through a series of dark, winding corridors until I finally arrive at my destination: a large, ornate room with a huge fireplace. Waiting for me is my client, a wealthy businessman. The businessman inspects the package I've delivered, and then hands me a envelope of cash. I thank him and then make my way back out to the truck. I'm relieved to be finished with the delivery, and I can't wait to get back down the mountain and back to civilization.
