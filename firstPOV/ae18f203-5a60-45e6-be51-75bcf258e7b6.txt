I'm working on a construction site in Africa. It's a hot, dusty day and I'm sweating profusely. I'm operating a jackhammer, breaking up concrete. The noise is deafening. I stop for a break and wipe the sweat from my brow. I take a sip of water from my canteen and look around. I see the other workers, some operating machinery, some lugging heavy loads of materials. I hear a loud roar and look up to see a lion walking across the site. Everyone stops what they're doing and watches as the lion calmly strolls through the construction site. After a few minutes, the lion moves on and everyone goes back to work. I pick up my jackhammer and resume breaking up the concrete.
