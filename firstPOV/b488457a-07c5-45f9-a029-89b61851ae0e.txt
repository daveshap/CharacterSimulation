I'm a babysitter who is watching over two young children while their parents are away. It is early in the morning, and I'm getting the children ready for their day. I help them brush their teeth and hair, and then get them dressed in their clothes. After that, I give the children breakfast and help them eat. Once the children are finished, I clean up their mess and then take them outside to play.
