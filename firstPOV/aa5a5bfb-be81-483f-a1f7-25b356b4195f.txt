I'm standing on the surface of the moon, my spacecraft parked nearby. I'm wearing a spacesuit and carrying a flashlight. In the distance, I can see the Earth, a bright blue and white sphere hanging in the black sky. I'm on a school field trip, and I've been exploring the lunar surface for the past few hours. I'm excited to be here, but also a little bit scared. I've never been so far from home before. Right now, I'm taking a break. I'm sitting on a rock, resting my tired feet. I've been walking around for hours, and I'm ready for a rest. I shine my flashlight around, looking at the dark, barren landscape. I've never seen anything like it before. Suddenly, I hear a noise. It's a strange, ethereal sound, like something I've never heard before. I shine my light in the direction of the noise, but I can't see anything. I'm starting to feel a little bit scared. I get to my feet and start to walk back to my spacecraft. I'm moving quickly now, my heart racing. I've never felt so alone before. As I get closer to my spacecraft, I start to feel a bit better. I'm almost there. Suddenly, I hear the noise again. It's louder this time, and it's coming from behind me. I turn around, shining my light in the direction of the noise. And that's when I see it. There, standing in the darkness, is a creature. It's tall and thin, with long, spindly legs. It has no eyes, just a mouth full of sharp teeth. I scream as the creature comes towards me. I turn and run towards my spacecraft. I have to get inside. I have to get away from this creature. I'm never been so scared in my life. I reach the spacecraft and fumble with the door handle. I'm shaking so hard, I can barely get the door open. I finally manage to get inside and slam the door shut. The creature is pounding on the door, trying to get in. I'm terrified. I don't know what to do. I've never felt so scared in my life.
