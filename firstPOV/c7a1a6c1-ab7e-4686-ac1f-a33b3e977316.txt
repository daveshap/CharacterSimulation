I'm walking through the dark forest, holding my baby close to me. I'm getting scared as the sun starts to set and the shadows get longer. I hear a noise in the distance and start to run, but I trip on a tree root and fall to the ground. I hear the noise getting closer and closer, and I start to scream for help. Suddenly, a large jaguar appears out of the shadows and starts to attack me. I fight back, but the jaguar is too strong. It drags me away into the darkness, leaving my baby crying alone on the forest floor.
