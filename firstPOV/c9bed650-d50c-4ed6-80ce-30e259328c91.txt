I'm sitting on the beach, watching the sunset. I'm thinking about my life and how grateful I am for what I have. I'm also thinking about my future and what I want to do with my life. I've been working as a software engineer for the past few years, but I'm starting to feel like I'm not doing what I really want to do. I'm beginning to think that maybe I want to do something else with my life. I'm not sure what, but I know that I want to make a change.
