I'm in my bedroom, getting ready for lunch. I'm putting on a shirt and jeans, and I look in the mirror to make sure I look presentable. I then head downstairs to the kitchen, where my husband and children are already sitting at the table. Everyone greets each other and they all start eating. My husband asks me how my day is going, and I respond that it's going well. We all chat while we eat, and then my husband asks if I want to go for a walk after lunch. I agree, and we all finish up and head out. My husband and I walk down the street, chatting and enjoying the nice day. We talk about our plans for the weekend, and my husband mentions that he might go fishing with his buddies. I say that sounds like fun, and we continue walking. After a while, we come to a park and decide to sit down for a break. We people watch for a while, and then my husband asks me if I want to head home. I say yes, and we get up and head back home. When we get home, my husband says he's going to take a nap. I say that's a good idea, and I head upstairs to my bedroom. I lie down on my bed and close my eyes, taking a moment to relax.
