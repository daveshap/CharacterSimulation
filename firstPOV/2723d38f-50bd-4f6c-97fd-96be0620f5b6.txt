I sit on the bench, watching the sun set behind the mountains. The orange glow is beautiful, and the snow-capped peaks look like they're glowing. I'm bundled up in a warm coat and scarf, and I'm happy to just sit here and enjoy the quiet. I've been babysitting the kids all evening, and they're finally asleep. It's been a long day, but I'm happy to just sit here and enjoy the peace and quiet.
