I enter my bedroom and close the door behind me. I walk over to the window and look outside. The sun is beginning to set and the sky is a beautiful orange color. I then walk over to my bed and sit down. I look around the room and see that everything is in its place. I then get up and walk over to my dresser. I open the top drawer and pull out a pair of clean socks. I then go over to my closet and take out a pair of jeans and a shirt. I get dressed and then walk over to the mirror. I look at myself and make sure that I look presentable. I then brush my hair and head out of the room.
