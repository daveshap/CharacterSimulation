When I arrived at the cottage, I was greeted by the owner, who invited me in for a cup of tea. I accepted, and we sat down in the cosy living room. The owner asked me about my work, and I told him about my day. The owner then asked me if I would like to stay for dinner, and I accepted. We enjoyed a lovely meal together, and I was grateful for the owner's hospitality.
