I was just finishing up my delivery shift when I decided to take a walk on the beach. The sun was setting and the sky was a beautiful orange. The waves were crashing against the shore, and I could hear the sound of people laughing and playing in the distance. I took a deep breath of the salty air and felt my muscles relax. It had been a long day, but it was good to be out in nature. I started to walk towards the sound of the people, but suddenly I heard a scream. I turned around and saw a woman running towards me, her face terror. She was being chased by a man with a knife, and I knew I had to help her. I ran towards the man and tackled him to the ground. The knife fell out of his hand and the woman ran to safety. I restrained the man until the police arrived. It had been a long day, but I felt good knowing I was able to help someone in need.
