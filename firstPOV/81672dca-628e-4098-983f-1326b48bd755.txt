I sat on the edge of the mat, watching my children play in the sand. I loved this quiet beach; it was always so peaceful here. The sound of the waves crashing against the shore was soothing, and the warm sun felt good on my skin. My children were laughing and playing happily. They loved coming to the beach, too. I smiled as I watched them play. I was grateful to have such wonderful kids. Suddenly, I saw a movement out of the corner of my eye. I turned to see a large, dark bird flying towards me. The bird was getting closer and closer, and I started to feel scared. The bird was almost upon me when I finally managed to scramble to my feet and run away. I could hear the bird's wings flapping behind me, and I was terrified that it was going to catch me. Fortunately, I made it to safety and the bird did not catch me. I was shaken by the experience, but I was thankful that I and my children were safe.
