I was babysitting my two young charges in a remote cabin deep in the forest when I heard a strange noise outside. I got up to investigate and saw a large, furry creature lurking in the shadows. The creature was watching me with its glowing yellow eyes, and I could see that it was covered in blood. I realized that it was a werewolf, and I was in serious trouble. The werewolf lashed out at me, but I was able to dodge its attack. I grabbed the children and ran into the woods, the werewolf close behind me. I was a fast runner, but the werewolf was gaining on me. I knew I couldn't outrun it, so I looked for somewhere to hide. I found a large tree with a hollow trunk, and I scrambled inside, pulling the kids in with me. The werewolf howled in frustration outside the tree, but it couldn't get to us. I knew we were safe for now, but I knew the werewolf would be back. I had to find a way to kill it before that happened.
