I'm sitting on the porch of a small hut, minding a group of small children. It's a hot day, and the children are running around and playing games to stay cool. I'm fanning myself with a piece of cardboard, and occasionally spritzing the children with a water bottle to keep them from getting too sweaty. lunch time is always a busy time for me. I have to watch the children, make sure they stay out of the sun, and stop them from fighting with each other. But I don't mind, because I love children. And besides, it's not like I have anything else to do. I grew up in this small village in Africa. I never went to school, and my parents could not afford to send me away to get an education. So instead, I started working as a babysitter when I was just a teenager. It's not the most glamorous job, but it's honest work, and I'm good at it. The children are starting to get restless, so I stand up and start to lead them in a game of tag. I know that if I can tire them out now, they'll be more likely to take a nap later. And I can use the break to catch up on my own rest.
