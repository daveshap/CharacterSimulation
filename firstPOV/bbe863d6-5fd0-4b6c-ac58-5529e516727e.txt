I'm out on a nature walk, enjoying the fresh air and incredible wildlife. I've been marveling at the lions and elephants all morning, and now I've stopped to take a break in the shade of a massive tree. I'm sitting on the ground, leaning against the tree trunk. I've taken off my shoes and socks, and am enjoying the feel of the grass on my feet. I'm sipping from a bottle of water, and nibbling on a granola bar. I'm feeling happy and relaxed, surrounded by the beauty of nature. Suddenly, I hear a loud rustling in the bushes nearby. My heart starts to race as I wonder what kind of animal is coming towards me. Is it a dangerous predator? I slowly get to my feet, ready to run if necessary. But then, out from the bushes, emerges a curious looking gazelle. It boldly approaches me, sniffing at my feet and clothes. I'm surprised, but delighted, by this friendly encounter. I slowly reach out to pet the gazelle, and it leans into my touch. After a few moments, the gazelle wanders off, and I am once again alone in the savannah. I resume my walk, feeling even more connected to this special place.
