The sun has just begun to peek over the horizon, painting the sky in a beautiful spectrum of oranges, pinks, and yellows. I am already up and about, getting ready to start my day as a delivery driver. I load up my van with the day's packages and set off on my route. The streets are busy with traffic as I weave in and out of lanes, making my deliveries as quickly as I can. I know that the sooner I get my job done, the sooner I can get home to my family. I also know that if I don't hurry, I'll be stuck in traffic for hours. I am grateful for my job, even though it's not the most glamorous. I know that it's not easy to find work these days, and I'm thankful that I can provide for my family. I also know that my job is important, because I'm helping to keep the city running. As I make my final delivery of the day, I can't help but feel a sense of pride. I've worked hard today, and I know that I've made a difference. I can't wait to get home to my family and tell them all about my day.
