I was sitting on the porch at school, enjoying my lunch and the beautiful view. I was surrounded by my classmates, who were chatting and laughing. All of a sudden, a lion appeared out of nowhere and started stalking me. The other students screamed and ran away, but I was frozen in fear. The lion got closer and I was sure that I was going to die. But then, something amazing happened. The lion stopped and sat down next to me, as if it was trying to comfort me. I slowly relaxed and started petting the lion. It was an incredible experience that I'll never forget.
