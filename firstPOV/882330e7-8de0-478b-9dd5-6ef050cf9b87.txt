The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon as I walked down the beach. I took a deep breath in, filling my lungs with the salty air. It was going to be a beautiful day. I spotted a few people further down, walking their dogs or jogging. Everyone seemed to be enjoying the peace and quiet of the morning. Suddenly, I heard a loud scream. I turned around and saw a woman running towards me, her face panicked. She was hysterical, and it took me a moment to understand what she was saying. "Help! There's a man with a knife! He's going to kill me!" My heart raced as I realized what was happening. I quickly looked around, but didn't see anyone. The woman was still running towards me, and I could see the terror in her eyes. I didn't know what to do. Should I run away? Hide? I didn't have time to make a decision. The next thing I knew, I was on the ground, gasping for air. I couldn't believe it. I'd been stabbed. I felt the warm blood running down my side and knew I was in trouble. The woman was still screaming, and I could hear the sound of footsteps running away. I tried to get up, but my body was weak and I couldn't move. I lay there, helpless, as the footsteps faded into the distance.
