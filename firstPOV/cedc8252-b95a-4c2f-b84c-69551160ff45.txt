I'm walking through the forest, holding a torch in one hand and a baby in the other. I'm careful to watch my step, as the ground is uneven and there are roots and rocks protruding from the earth. I've been walking for some time, and I'm now quite tired. The baby is getting heavy, and my arm is starting to throb from the effort of carrying it. I turn a corner, and the forest opens up into a small clearing. In the center of the clearing is a small, dilapidated cabin. I approach the cabin cautiously, my heart pounding in my chest. I know that this is where the witch lives. I knock on the door of the cabin, and a few moments later, an old woman answers. The woman is hunched over and has a long, hooked nose. She is wearing a tattered black dress and a black shawl. "Who are you?" the woman hisses. "I'm Gabbi," I respond. "I'm here to drop off the baby." The witch takes the baby from my arms and cackles wickedly. "Thank you, my dear. You have served me well." I turn and run back the way I came, my heart pounding in my chest. I know that I have just delivered a baby to a monster, and I will never forget the look on the witch's face.
