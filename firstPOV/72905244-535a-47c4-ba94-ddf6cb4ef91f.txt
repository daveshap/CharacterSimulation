I'm sitting on the beach, watching the sun set. The sky is a beautiful orange, and the waves are crashing against the shore. I'm babysitting two children, who are playing in the sand nearby. I'm thinking about my life and what I want to do with it. I feel like I'm at a crossroads and am not sure which path to take.
