I was in the middle of my night shift at the grocery store when I heard a noise coming from the dark forest outside. I went to investigate and saw a group of men carrying large sacks of what looked like cocaine. I was not sure what to do, but I knew I had to do something. I ran back to the store and called the police. When the police arrived, they apprehended the men and took them into custody. I was a hero!
