I'm walking along the beach, admiring the sunset. I've been working hard all day and I'm looking forward to relaxing. As I approach a quiet spot, I notice something shining in the sand. I bend down to pick it up, and it's a gold necklace. I look around to see if anyone is nearby, but there's no one in sight. I put the necklace in my pocket and continue walking.
