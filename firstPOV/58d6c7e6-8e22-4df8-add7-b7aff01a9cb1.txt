I'm Swathi, a software engineer, and I love my work. I've been assigned to a new project that will take me to the moon. I'm excited to be working on something so cutting edge and important. As I begin my work, I look up at the sky and see the sun setting. The sky is a beautiful orange, and the stars are just beginning to come out. I can't help but feel a sense of wonder at the sight. I spend the next few hours working on my project, and as the night goes on, I start to feel a sense of peace. I've always loved the night, and there's something about being on the moon that makes me feel even more connected to the universe. I work until the early hours of the morning, and when I finally stop, I look up at the sky again. The moon is now high in the sky, and the stars are shining brightly. I feel a sense of accomplishment at a job well done, and I know that I've made a difference.
