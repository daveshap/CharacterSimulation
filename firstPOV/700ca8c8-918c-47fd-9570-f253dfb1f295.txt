I'm driving my delivery truck through a dark forest in South America. I'm getting close to my destination, but I'm starting to get worried because I can't see anything in the darkness. I'm also starting to hear strange noises coming from the woods. Finally, I arrive at the address I was looking for. I get out of the truck, but I'm immediately attacked by a creature that comes out of the darkness. I scream as I'm being pulled into the darkness.
