I'm behind the bar, wiping glasses and getting ready for the evening rush. I'm wearing a black apron over my clothes and a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up. My hair is dark and curly, and I have a close-cut beard. I look up as the first few customers come in and greet them with a smile. The bar is situated under the Eiffel Tower, and the view from the windows is breathtaking. The ceiling is high and vaulted, and the walls are lined with shelves of liquor. The floor is polished wood, and there are small round tables scattered around the room. The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly, and I'm happy to chat with the customers as I serve them drinks. As the evening wears on, the bar gets busier and I'm kept busy serving drinks and clearing tables. I laugh and joke with the customers, and it's obvious that I enjoy my job. I'm quick and efficient, and I know just how to make each customer feel special. As closing time approaches, I start to tidy up the bar, wiping down the surfaces and getting everything ready for the next day. The last few customers finish their drinks and say goodbye, and then I'm alone in the bar. I lock the doors and turn off the lights, and then I head home for the night.
