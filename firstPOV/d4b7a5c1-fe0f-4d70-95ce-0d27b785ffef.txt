I was sitting in front of the fireplace, enjoying the peace and quiet, when I suddenly heard a noise outside. I got up to investigate, but didn't see anything. I was just about to go back inside when I saw a figure in the distance. The figure was coming closer, and I could see that it was a woman. She was walking quickly, and it looked like she was in a hurry. As she got closer, I could see that she was carrying a bundle in her arms. The woman saw me and came to a stop. She looked relieved and happy to see me. She asked me if I could help her. She explained that she'd been walking for hours, and she was exhausted. She asked me if I could take her in and give her a place to stay for the night. I agreed and invited the woman inside. I led her to the guest room and put her to bed. The woman thanked me and told me that I was a good man. I said goodnight and went back to my own room.
