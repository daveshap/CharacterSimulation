I'm walking along the beach, enjoying the quiet night. The waves crash against the shore, and the stars shine overhead. I take a deep breath of the salty air and smile. Suddenly, I hear a noise behind me. I turn around and see a shadowy figure running towards me. My heart races as I wonder what to do. Should I run away or confront the person? I decide to stand my ground and see that the person is a woman. She looks frantic and seems to be running from something. I ask her if she's okay, but she doesn't seem to hear me. She runs past me and continues down the beach. I'm about to follow her when I hear more noise. This time, it sounds like someone is coming towards me. I turn around and see a group of men walking towards me with angry looks on their faces. They seem to be looking for the woman. I'm torn about what to do, but I know I can't just let them hurt her. I run after the woman to warn her.
