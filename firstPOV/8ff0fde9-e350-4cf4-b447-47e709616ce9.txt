The sun is just beginning to peek over the mountaintops, casting a pink and orange glow across the sky. A chill wind is blowing, and I'm huddled up in my coat, shivering. I've been up here all night, waiting for the perfect moment to take a photograph. The mountaintop is covered in a light dusting of snow, and my breath forms little clouds in the air. My fingers are numb from the cold, but I'm determined to get the shot I came for. Suddenly, the sun pops up over the horizon, and I snap the picture. I can't believe I got it! The view is absolutely stunning, and I know this photo is going to be a winner.
