As I hurry along the sidewalk, I can hear the city busting with activity even though the sun is setting. Streetlights flicker to life, illuminating the sidewalk. I'm on my way home from work, eager to put my feet up and relax after a long day. The sounds of horns and footsteps echo around me as I weave through the crowd, finally arriving at my apartment building. I fumble for my keys, unlocking the door and stepping inside. The apartment is quiet and empty, and I'm hit with a sudden wave of loneliness. I push it away, heading to the kitchen to start dinner. As I cook, my mind wanders back to my work day. I've been struggling with my project for weeks now, and my boss is starting to get impatient. I'm determined to find a solution, but I'm feeling drained. I sit down at the table with my dinner, picking at my food distractedly. Tomorrow is another long day, and I'm not sure how much more I can take.
