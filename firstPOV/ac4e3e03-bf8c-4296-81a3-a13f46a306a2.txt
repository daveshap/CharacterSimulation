I'm Mashawn, a construction worker who's currently working on the renovation of the Eiffel Tower. It's now 6pm and I'm just about to finish my shift. I climb down from the scaffolding and stretch my aching muscles. I look up at the Tower, admiring my handiwork. I then turn to go home but am stopped by my boss. My boss tells me that there is one more task that needs to be done before we can call it a day. We need to move one of the large beams that's blocking the entrance to the Tower. I groan but agree to help. Me and my fellow workers spend the next hour trying to move the beam but it's too heavy. We're just about to give up when I have an idea. I climb back up to the scaffolding and loosen one of the bolts. The beam falls to the ground with a loud thud. The workers cheer and pat me on the back. My boss looks relieved and tells me that I can go home. I grab my things and head home, tired but satisfied.
