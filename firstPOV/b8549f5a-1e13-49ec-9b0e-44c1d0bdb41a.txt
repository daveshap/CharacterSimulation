I'm standing in the middle of a packed concert hall, surrounded by screaming fans. I'm wearing a bright pink shirt and blue jeans, and I have a pink streak in my hair. I'm holding a microphone in one hand and a guitar in the other, and I'm smiling and dancing around. The crowd is going wild, cheering and clapping along with my music.
