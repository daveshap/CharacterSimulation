I'm sitting at my desk, surrounded by stacks of paper. My computer is on, but the screen is blank. I'm wearing a headset, and I'm tapping my fingers impatiently on the desk. I look around the room, and my eyes settle on the door. Suddenly, I stand up and walk to the door. I open it, and I see my husband, Bob, standing there. "Hi, Sandy," he says. "I thought I'd surprise you with a visit." "Hi, Bob," I say. "Come on in." He walk into the room, and he looks around. "This place is a mess," he says. "What have you been doing all day?" "I've been trying to get some work done," I say. "But it's hard to concentrate with the kids at home." "Well, maybe you should get a babysitter," he says. "It would be good for you to get out of the house." "I don't know," I say. "I'm not sure I'm ready to leave the kids." "It would be good for you," he says. "And it would give me a chance to spend more time with them." "Maybe you're right," I say. "I'll think about it."
