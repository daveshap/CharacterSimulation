I'm standing at the base of the Eifel Tower, looking up at it in wonder. I've never seen anything like it before. I'm here on a school trip, and I've been looking forward to it for months. I'm never been out of my home country before, and I'm excited to see all the sights. The tower is even more impressive up close. I can't believe I'm actually here. I take a few pictures, then start to walk around, taking everything in. There's a group of other students nearby, laughing and joking. They seem to be having a great time. I smile, feeling happy to be here. Suddenly, I hear a loud noise. I turn around to see the Eifel Tower collapsing. It falls to the ground with a deafening crash, sending dust and debris everywhere. I'm frozen in shock. I can't believe what I'm seeing. The Eifel Tower, one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, is now a pile of rubble. People are screaming and running around in panic. I'm still in shock, and I can't move. I just stand there, staring at the wreckage. Eventually, someone comes and leads me away. I can't take my eyes off the tower, and the image of it collapsing will stay with me forever.
