I was enjoying a peaceful lunch on my porch when I heard a loud noise coming from the road. I got up to see what was going on, and I saw a car speeding down the road, followed by a police car with its sirens blaring. The car sped past my cottage, and I could see that the driver was a young woman. She looked panicked. The police car followed close behind, and I watched as the two vehicles disappeared down the road. I went back to my lunch, and I couldn't help but wonder what the young woman was doing that was so bad that she needed to flee from the police. I wondered if I'd ever find out what happened.
