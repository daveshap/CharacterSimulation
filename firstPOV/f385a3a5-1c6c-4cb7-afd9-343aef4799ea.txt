I'm walking through a dark forest in South America, holding a flashlight in one hand and a machete in the other. My clothes are torn and I have several scratches on my face and arms. I'm obviously lost and scared. I keep looking around, as if expecting something to jump out at me at any moment. I stop often to listen, but all I can hear is the sound of my own breathing and the pounding of my heart. Suddenly, I hear a branch snap. I whirl around, shining my flashlight in the direction of the sound. But there's nothing there. Just trees and shadows. I start to walk again, faster now, my heart pounding in my chest. I know I'm being watched. I can feel it. But I don't know what to do. I can't go back the way I came. I have to keep going forward. I don't see the snake until it's too late. It strikes me on the leg and I yelp in pain. I swing my machete wildly, trying to hit it, but I miss. The snake strikes again and I fall to the ground, screaming in fear and pain. And then I'm being dragged into the darkness, my screams echoing through the forest.
