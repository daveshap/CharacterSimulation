I'm babysitting beneath the Eiffel Tower on a busy afternoon. The kids are running and playing all around me, and I'm doing my best to keep them under control. Every so often, one of them wanders off, and I have to go and retrieve them. I'm also keeping an eye on the time, as I have to return them to their parents in a few hours. Overall, I'm having a great time, despite the challenges of my job.
