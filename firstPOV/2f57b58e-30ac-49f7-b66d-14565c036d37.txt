I pull up to the country cottage and climb out of my truck. I stretch my arms and legs and take a deep breath of the fresh air. I walk up to the door and knock. A moment later, the door opens and a young woman greets me. She smiles and thanks me for coming. I hand her a package and she signs for it. We exchange a few pleasantries and then I bid her goodbye. I climb back into my truck and drive away. I feel good knowing that I've helped brighten someone's day.
