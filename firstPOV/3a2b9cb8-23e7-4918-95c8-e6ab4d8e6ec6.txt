I'm sitting at my desk in the office, eating my lunch, when I hear a loud bang from the other side of the building. I get up to investigate and see that one of the windows has been broken. I can see a group of people outside, throwing rocks at the building. I run back to my desk and call the police, then gather up all the children in the office and bring them into a safe room. I help them stay calm until the police arrive and the situation is under control.
