I'm busy preparing drinks for the happy hour crowd. I've got a shaker in one hand and a bottle of vodka in the other as I mix cocktails and chat with the customers. The TV is on in the background, tuned to the local news. The doors swing open as people stream in, eager to unwind after a long day. They take a seat at the bar or at one of the tables, chatting and laughing as they sip their drinks. I make my way down the bar, keeping everyone's glasses full. The mood is light and festive as people enjoy each other's company and relax after a long day.
