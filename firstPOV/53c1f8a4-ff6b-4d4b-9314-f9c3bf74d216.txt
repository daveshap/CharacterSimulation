I woke up to the sun peeking over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow across the sky. A light breeze rustled the leaves of the trees surrounding the small country cottage. Birds were singing in the distance. All was peaceful and calm. I stretched and yawned, then climbed out of bed and headed to the window. I smiled as I looked out at the beautiful morning. Everything was so perfect and peaceful. Suddenly, I heard a loud crash from the other room. I froze, my heart racing. What is that? I slowly crept to the door and peeked around the corner. I saw a large, furry creature rummaging through my backpack, which was lying on the floor. I gasped. It's a bear! The bear looked up and saw me. For a moment, we just stared at each other. Then, I turned and sprinted out the door. I didn't look back until I was safe.
