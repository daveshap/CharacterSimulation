The air is frigid and my breath mists in front of my face. I've been bartending for hours and am eager for my shift to end. I can see my breath in the cold night air and I can see the lights of the village below. I'm high up on the mountain, and the only sound is the howling of the wind. My relief arrives and I start to descend the mountain. The path is narrow and treacherous, and I am careful to take each step with care. I know that one false step could mean a deadly fall. As I near the bottom, I can see the lights of the village getting brighter and I can hear the sound of people talking and laughing. I'm finally made it back to safety.
