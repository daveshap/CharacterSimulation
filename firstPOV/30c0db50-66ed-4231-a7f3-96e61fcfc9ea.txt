I stand underneath the Eiffel Tower, my favourite spot in the city. I've been coming here ever since I moved to Paris for work, and it always makes me feel at home. The sun is setting and the sky is a beautiful orange colour. The tower is lit up and looks even more impressive than usual. I feel a sense of peace and happiness being here. I take a deep breath and close my eyes, letting the moment wash over me.
