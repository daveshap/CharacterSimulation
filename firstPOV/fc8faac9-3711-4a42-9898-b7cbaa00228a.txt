As I enter the cottage, the sun is shining brightly outside. It's a peaceful place, with a small garden out front and a woodpile off to the side. Inside, the cottage is cozy and warm, with a fire burning in the fireplace. I hang my coat up and go to check on the children, who are playing happily in the next room. Everything is calm and peaceful, and I can't help but feel happy in this idyllic setting.
