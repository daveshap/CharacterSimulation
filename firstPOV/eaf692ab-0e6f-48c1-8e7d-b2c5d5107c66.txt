I'm standing on the moon, near the edge of a crater. I look up and the sky is beginning to turn a deep blue. The stars are just starting to come out, and I can see the Earth in the distance - a bright blue and white sphere hanging in the sky. I'm wearing a spacesuit, but I've removed my helmet and I'm breathing the air of the moon. I feel a sense of exhilaration being on the surface of the moon, and I can't help but to smile. Suddenly, I hear a noise behind me and I turn around to see a large, dark object rising up out of the crater. My heart starts to race as I realize that I am not alone on the moon.
