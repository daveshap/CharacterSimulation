I'm Wang, a delivery driver, and I'm currently under the Eifel Tower. I've been asked to deliver a package to a nearby restaurant, but I'm having trouble finding the place. I've been walking around for a while, and I'm starting to get tired. I'm starting to get frustrated. I've been walking around for a while, and I still can't find the restaurant. I'm about to give up when I see a sign for the restaurant. I finally found it!
