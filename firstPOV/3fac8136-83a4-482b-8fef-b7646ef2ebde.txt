I was sitting on my porch, enjoying a cup of coffee and taking in the beautiful sunset, when I suddenly heard a loud noise coming from the direction of the forest. It sounded like someone was running and crying for help. I jumped up from my chair and ran towards the noise. As I got closer, I could see a young woman, frantic and out of breath, running towards me. She was being chased by a large, scary-looking man with a knife. I didn't hesitate. I ran towards the man and tackled him to the ground. The woman was safe now and I had saved her life.
