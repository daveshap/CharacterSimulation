I arrived at the beach at 6pm. I was carrying a large beach bag and an umbrella. I walked to where the family was sitting and put the umbrella in the sand. I greeted the family and took the baby from the mother. The father handed me a diaper bag and I put it over my shoulder. I walked with the baby to the water's edge. I sat down in the sand and began to change the baby's diaper. The baby cooed and gurgled as I changed him. After the diaper was changed, I put the baby on my lap and began to play with him. The baby grabbed my fingers and laughed. I tickled the baby's tummy and he giggled. The sun began to set and the sky turned a beautiful orange color. The waves crashing on the shore sounded like music to me and the baby. We sat there for a while, just watching the sun set. It was a beautiful evening.
