I love coming to this beach in the morning. The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, and the sky is a beautiful pink and orange. The waves are crashing gently against the shore, and the sand is cool and soft. I can sit here for hours and just watch the sunrise and enjoy the peace and quiet. It's become my favorite place to relax and clear my head.
