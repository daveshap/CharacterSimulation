I was sitting at my desk, typing away on my computer, when I heard a noise coming from the hallway. I got up to investigate and saw a man walking down the hall, carrying a stack of papers. The man didn't notice me and kept walking. I went back to my desk and gathered my things. Then I turned off the lights and left the office, locking the door behind me.
