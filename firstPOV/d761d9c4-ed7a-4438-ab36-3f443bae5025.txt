I was working at my grocery store early in the morning, before the sun had even risen, when I suddenly heard a loud noise from outside. I looked out the window and saw the Eiffel Tower falling over! I dropped everything and ran outside to see if anyone was hurt. I saw people running and screaming everywhere. I looked up at the tower and saw that it was about to fall on me! I ran away as fast as I could and narrowly missed being crushed by the fallen structure.
