I was watching the sun set behind the mountains from my coffee shop when I saw a figure come over the top of the mountain and start down the other side. I assumed it was a hiker out for an evening walk. I watched the figure for a while, until they disappeared out of view. A few minutes later, I saw another figure come over the top of the mountain. This one was moving much faster than the first, and I could see that they were carrying something. It looked like a backpack, and they were headed down the mountain at a pretty good clip. I wondered if the second hiker was chasing the first, or if they were just in a hurry to get somewhere. I continued to watch the mountain, but I didn't see any more hikers. After a few minutes, I went back to work, cleaning up the shop for the night.
