I'm taking the kids to the park today and pointing out all the different animals and plants. They're excited and asking lots of questions. After a few hours of playing, they're ready to go home. I take them by the hand and lead them back to the house. Along the way, we spot a snake sunning itself on a rock. I carefully point it out to the kids, making sure they don't get too close. When we arrive home, the kids' parents are there to greet us. I hand the kids off to their parents and say goodbye. I have another job to go to, but I'll be back tomorrow to play with the kids again.
