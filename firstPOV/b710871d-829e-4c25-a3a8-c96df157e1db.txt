I'm a delivery driver, and right now I'm making a delivery under the Eiffel Tower. It's early in the morning, and the streets are pretty empty. I'm driving a small delivery truck, and I'm stopped at a red light, about to turn onto a side street. I'm a little bit nervous because I've never made a delivery to this particular address before. I'm also nervous because I don't know the area very well, and I don't want to get lost. As I sit at the red light, I look out the window at the Eiffel Tower. It's a really impressive structure, and I can't help but feel a little bit awestruck. I've always wanted to visit the tower, but I've never had the opportunity. I wonder if I'll ever have the chance to see it up close. The light turns green, and I proceed to turn onto the side street. I'm relieved to see that there are no other vehicles on the street. I'm also relieved to see that the address I'm looking for is clearly marked. I pull up to the address and park the truck. I take a deep breath and prepare to make the delivery.
