I walk through the dark forest, carrying a lantern in one hand and a machete in the other. I've been walking for hours, and I'm getting tired. The only sound is the crunching of leaves under my feet. I'm getting worried - I've lost my way. I stop and look around. I can't see anything in the darkness. I'm about to give up and sit down when I hear a noise. It sounds like someone is crying. I follow the sound until I come to a clearing. In the center of the clearing is a small mound of dirt. I set down my lantern and machete and start to dig. After a few minutes, I uncovers a small child, huddled in a fetal position. The child is crying and shaking with fear. I pick him up and try to comfort him. The child is scared and won't stop crying. I don't know what to do. I look around the clearing and see a small hut. I take the child to the hut and set him down on a bed. He then goes back outside to get his things. When I come back inside, I see the child lying on the bed, fast asleep. I'm relieved and happy that I was able to help.
