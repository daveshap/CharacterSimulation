I'm working the graveyard shift at a construction site in the city. I've been working for hours, and I'm starting to get tired. The bright city lights are giving me a headache. I take a break and sit down on a bench. I take out my phone and start scrolling through social media. I see a post about a party that's happening tonight. I remember that I was invited. I decide to go to the party. I finish my break and go back to work. I work for another hour before I'm finally done for the night. I clean up my work area and go to clock out. I'm looking forward to going to the party and letting loose. I walk to the party location, which is a warehouse in a shady part of town. I can hear the music from outside. I walk in and see people dancing and drinking. I see my friends and go over to them. They hand me a drink and we all start dancing. I've been dancing and drinking for a while now and I'm starting to feel buzzed. I'm having a great time. I'm laughing and joking with my friends. I see a girl across the room and start to feel attracted to her. I start to make my way over to her. As I'm walking, I trip over a coil of rope and fall. I hit my head on a table and am knocked unconscious. My friends come over and help me up. They take me to the hospital.
