I was lying in bed, asleep, when I was suddenly awoken by a loud noise outside. I sat up in bed, heart racing, and listened carefully. There were footsteps on the porch, and someone was trying to open the door. I was terrified. I didn't know what to do. Should I hide under the bed? Should I call the police? Just as I was about to make a decision, the door burst open and a masked figure burst into the room. I screamed and tried to run, but the intruder was too quick. He grabbed me and put a hand over my mouth to silence me. I struggled and panicked, but I knew I was in trouble. The intruder dragged me out of the bedroom and into the living room, where he pushed me down onto the couch. He tied my hands and feet with rope, and then he started to search the house. I was scared and helpless. I didn't know what the intruder was looking for, or what he was going to do to me when he found it. I could only wait and hope that someone would come to help me before it was too late.
