I had just pulled up to the cottage and was getting the delivery out of the truck when I heard a loud noise. It sounded like something had crashed into the house. I quickly dropped the delivery and ran to the front door to see what was going on. When I got to the door, I saw a large hole in the wall and a man standing in the middle of the room, holding a baseball bat. The man was wearing a mask and I couldn't see his face. The man swung the bat at me and I ducked out of the way. I ran into the kitchen and grabbed a knife from the counter. The man followed me and swung the bat at me again. I dodged out of the way and stabbed the man in the leg with the knife. The man dropped the bat and grabbed his leg, screaming in pain. I ran to the front door and opened it, then ran outside and yelled for help.
