I'm standing in the middle of the crowd, swaying to the music. The sun is beating down on me, but I don't care. I'm lost in the music, dancing and singing along with the rest of the crowd. I'm wearing a flowy dress and my hair is pulled back in a messy bun. I look like I'm having the time of my life.
