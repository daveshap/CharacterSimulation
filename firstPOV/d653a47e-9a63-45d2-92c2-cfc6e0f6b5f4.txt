I'm out on a walk, enjoying the quiet of the morning. The air is still and the only sound is the crunching of my footsteps on the dusty ground. I'm walking along a path that leads to a small hill. From the top of the hill, you can see the Earth off in the distance. I like to come here to watch the sunrise and think about my life back on Earth. I've been on the moon for about a year now, and I'm still not used to the everyday sights and sounds. Everything is so different here, but in a good way. It's like being in a whole new world. As I reach the top of the hill, I sit down and watch as the sun slowly rises over the Earth. The colors are beautiful, and I can see the different continents and countries. It's a peaceful moment, and I feel lucky to be able to experience it.
