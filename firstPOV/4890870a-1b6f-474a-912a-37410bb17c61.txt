I'm walking through the dark forest, trying to find my way back to camp. I'm getting scared as the sun starts to set and the woods get darker. I hear some strange noises and start to run, but trip on a tree root and fall to the ground. I look up and see a large beast standing over me, drooling and growling. I'm terrified and think I'm going to be eaten alive. The beast leans down and starts to sniff me, but then turns and walks away. I'm relieved, but now I'm lost and alone in the dark forest.
