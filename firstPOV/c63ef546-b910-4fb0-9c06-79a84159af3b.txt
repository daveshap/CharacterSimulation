I was walking through the forest, my heart pounding in my chest. I could hear the sounds of the animals all around me, and I was terrified that one of them would attack me. I kept my hand on my knife, ready to defend myself if necessary. Suddenly, I heard a noise behind me and I spun around, my heart in my throat. But it's just a small animal, scurrying away into the underbrush. I exhale a sigh of relief and continue on, my heart still pounding. I have been walking for hours, and I am getting tired. I am just about to sit down and rest for a few minutes when I hear a noise in the distance. It sounds like people? I start to walk towards the noise, and as I get closer, I can see the light of a fire. As I approach, I can see that there are people around the fire. They are all dressed in strange clothing, and they don't look like anything I have ever seen before. I stop, not knowing what to do, and then I hear someone call my name. It's my husband, Tom. He's been missing for weeks, and I can't believe he's here. I run to him, and they embrace each other tightly. I can't believe I've found him alive.
