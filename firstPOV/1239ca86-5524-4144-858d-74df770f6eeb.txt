I'm sitting on the veranda, watching the children play in the garden as the sun sets. The sky is painted in a beautiful array of oranges, pinks and yellows. I smile as I watch them chasing each other around, their laughter filling the air. As the sky grows darker, I start to sing a lullaby to the children. They quickly settle down and come to sit with me, their eyes heavy with sleep. I continue to sing as they drift off to sleep, their heads resting on my lap. Once they are both asleep, I gently lay them down in their beds and tuck them in. I give them both a kiss goodnight and quietly leave the room, closing the door behind me.
