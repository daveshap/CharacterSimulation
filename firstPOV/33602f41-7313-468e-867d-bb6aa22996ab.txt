I sat on the edge of the bed, watching the two children sleeping soundly in their beds. It had been a long day, and I was grateful to finally have a moment to myself. I sat in silence for a few minutes, enjoying the peace and quiet, before I heard a noise coming from the hallway. I got up quietly, careful not to wake the children, and went to investigate. I saw the outline of a man standing in the shadow at the end of the hallway, and my heart started to race. I knew I should call the police, but I was frozen in fear. The man started to come towards me, and I backed up into the bedroom, my mind racing. I looked around for a weapon, anything I could use to defend myself, but there was nothing. The man was getting closer and closer, and I could see the murderous look in his eyes. I knew I was going to die. Just as the man was about to reach me, I heard the sound of sirens in the distance. The man hesitated for a moment, then turned and ran out the front door. I collapsed to the floor, shaking and crying with relief. The police had arrived just in time.
