I was in my bedroom, in the middle of the night, when I woke up and saw a man standing next to my bed. I wasn't afraid, because I knew he wasn't there to hurt me. He reached down and took my hand, and then he spoke. "I'm here to take you away," he said. "I'm here to take you to a place where you will be happy. A place where you will be safe. I promise." I got out of bed and took his hand, because I knew I could trust him. He was going to take me to a better place.
