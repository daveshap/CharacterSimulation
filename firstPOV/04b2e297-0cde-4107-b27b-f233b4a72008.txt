The Eifel Tower stands imposingly against the darkening sky, its arched metal frame illuminated by twinkling lights. I walk underneath it, my heart pounding in my chest. I've never been this close to the Eifel Tower before and I can't believe I'm finally here. I look up at the towering structure and feel a sense of awe. As I continue to walk, I notice a group of people off to the side, huddled around a small fire. They look rough and dirty, and I can see their breath in the cold air. Tentatively, I approach them. "Excuse me, do you speak English?" I ask. One of the men looks up at me and nods. "Yes, we do." I let out a sigh of relief. "I'm looking for a place to stay for the night. Do you know of any cheap hotels around here?" The man shakes his head. "No, sorry. We don't really know the area too well." My heart sinks. I've been walking around for hours and I'm exhausted. I don't know what I'm going to do. Just then, one of the women speaks up. "You can stay with us, if you want," she says, motioning to the ground next to her. "We have an extra blanket." I hesitate for a moment, but then I nod. "Thank you. I really appreciate it." I sit down next to the woman and huddle under the blanket for warmth. I've never been so grateful in my life. As I stare up at the Eifel Tower, I can't help but feel a sense of wonder. Even though I'm cold and exhausted, I know this is going to be a night I'll never forget.
