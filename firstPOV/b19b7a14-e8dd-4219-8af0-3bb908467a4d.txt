I'm working on the construction of a new lunar base. It's evening, and the sun is setting. I'm using a large drill to create a hole for the foundation of the base. I'm sweating profusely, and the drill is making a lot of noise. I'm surrounded by other workers, who are also sweating and working hard. The atmosphere is hot and dusty.
