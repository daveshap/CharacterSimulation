I'm sitting in the office building, waiting for my employer to come pick me up. It's 6pm and I'm getting a bit antsy. I've been sitting in the same spot for the past few minutes and I'm starting to get impatient. I look around the office and see that it's fairly empty, with only a few people milling about. I tap my foot impatiently and sigh.
