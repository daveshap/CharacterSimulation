I sit on the bench, watching the sun set behind the mountains. The clouds change color, and I can't help but feel grateful for this moment of peace. I've been babysitting the kids all day, and they're finally asleep. I'm tired, but this moment is refreshing. The air is cool and fresh, and I can see the whole valley below. I take a deep breath and let my mind wander.
