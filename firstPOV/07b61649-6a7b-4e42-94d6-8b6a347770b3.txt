I'm in the middle of the crowd, dancing and singing along with the music. I'm lost in the moment, surrounded by friends and fellow music lovers. The energy in the air is electric, and I'm loving every minute of it. Suddenly, the lights go out. There's a moment of confusion, and then the emergency lights come on. I can see the exits, and I start to head for the nearest one. The crowd is starting to panic, and people are pushing and shoving to try and get out. I'm jostled and shoved from all sides, but I manage to stay on my feet. Finally, I make it to the exit and out into the fresh air. The concert is over, but my night is just beginning. I'm exhilarated from the experience, and I know that I'm just going to have to find another show to take my mind off of what happened.
