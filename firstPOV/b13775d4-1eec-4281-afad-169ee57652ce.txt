The moon casts a eerie glow over the scene as I, Gabbi, a babysitter, watch over my sleeping charges. All is quiet save for the sound of my restless breathing. I can't help but feel on edge in this lonely place. Every so often, my eyes drift towards the window. Outside, the craters and rocks of the moon's surface are lit up by the Earth's distant blue glow. It's a beautiful sight, but it only serves to remind me of how far away I am from home. I'm not sure how much longer I can take this. The pay is good, but the isolation is driving me crazy. I'm beginning to feel like I'm the only human left in the universe. At least the kids are cute. That's something, at least.
