I'm at the concert, and it's incredible. The music is so loud and the crowd is so excited. I'm standing in the middle of it all, looking around in awe. I've never been to a concert before, and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. Suddenly, I spot a young girl sitting on the ground near the edge of the crowd. The girl looks lost and scared, and I can see that she's about to start crying. I make my way over to the girl and kneel down next to her. I ask her what's wrong, and the girl starts to sob. I comforting the girl and telling her it's going to be okay. I look around for the girl's parents, but I can't see them anywhere. So, I decide to take the girl under my wing for the rest of the concert. I hold her hand and help her to stand up, and we start to dance together. I'm now feeling more confident and having a great time. I know that I've made a new friend for life.
