I'm sweeping the floors and wiping down the countertops, making sure everything is clean for the morning rush. As I'm working, I look up at the clock and realize that I'm running late. I quickly finish up my chores and lock the door, turning off the lights as I go. I hurry home, eager to get back to my family. I know they'll be waiting for me, and I don't want to keep them up too late. As I walk through the empty streets, I can't help but feel a sense of loneliness. I'm one of the only people left on the moon, and it's a feeling I'm getting used to. But I know that I'm lucky. I have a home and a family to go back to, and I'm grateful for that. I know that as long as I have them, I'll be alright.
