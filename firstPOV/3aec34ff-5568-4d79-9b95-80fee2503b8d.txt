I'm a grocery store clerk working the evening shift. I'm restocking the shelves with fresh produce when I notice a commotion outside the store. I see a group of people gathering around a man who is shouting and waving his arms. I'm curious to see what's going on, so I set down the produce and go to investigate. As I get closer, I can hear the man screaming about how the government is lying to us and how we're all going to die. The man is sweating and his face is red with fury. The crowd around him is starting to get agitated, and some people are starting to shout back at the man. I can sense that the situation is getting out of control and I start to back away. Suddenly, the man pulls out a gun and starts firing into the crowd. People start screaming and running in all directions. I'm frozen in terror as I watch the man methodically shoot people who are trying to flee. After a few minutes, the man is the only one left standing. He looks around at the carnage he's caused, and then he turns and walks away calmly. I'm still in shock as I try to process what I've just witnessed. I can hear the sound of sirens in the distance, and I know that the police will be arriving soon. I feel like I should do something, but I'm too shaken to move. I can only stand here and stare at the bodies of the people who were killed. This is a nightmare that I know I will never forget.
