I'm driving my delivery truck up a winding mountain road in the dead of night. My headlights cut through the darkness, illuminating the endlessly twisting road ahead. My destination is a small village perched atop the mountain, and I know that I need to be careful not to miss the turnoff. As I near the top of the mountain, the road becomes even narrower and more treacherous. My truck scrapes against the cliffside at one point, sending a shower of rocks tumbling down into the darkness below. Finally, I reach the turnoff and begin the descent into the village. The village is dark and sleepy at this hour, and I have no trouble finding the address I'm looking for. I bring the truck to a stop in front of a small cottage and honk my horn to wake the occupants. A light comes on inside, and a moment later the door opens to reveal a sleepy-eyed man in his nightclothes. The man signs for the package and takes it inside, leaving me to drive back down the mountain and onto the next delivery.
