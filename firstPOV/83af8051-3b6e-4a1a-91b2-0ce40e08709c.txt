I was laying on my towel on the beach, soaking up the sun and enjoying the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. I had been there for a few hours, but it felt like the day was just flying by. I loved coming to this spot; it was so peaceful and calming. Suddenly, I heard a loud noise and sat up to see a group of people running towards me. I was confused and scared, wondering what was happening. The group was getting closer and I could see that they were all yelling and looked very panicked. Without knowing what else to do, I got up and started running towards the group. As I got closer, I could hear them yelling, "There's a shark! There's a shark!" My heart sank as I realized what was happening. Everyone was running in different directions, trying to get away from the shark. I was about to run towards the safety of the shore when I saw a little girl standing in the water, frozen in fear. My instinct was to save her. Without thinking any further, I ran towards the girl and scooped her up in my arms. I then started sprinting towards the shore as fast as I could. My heart was pounding in my chest as I ran, but I didn't stop until I reached the safety of the sand. Once I was out of the water, I put the little girl down and we both collapsed onto the sand, exhausted. I was relieved that we were both safe and thankful that I was able to help.
