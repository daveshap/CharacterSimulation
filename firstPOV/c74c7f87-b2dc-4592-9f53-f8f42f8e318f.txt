I'd always wanted to visit the Eifel Tower. I'd seen pictures of it in books and magazines, and it always looked so majestic and grand. Finally, I was able to make the trip and I was not disappointed. The tower was even more beautiful in person. As I walked around the tower, I noticed that there were several people milling about, taking pictures and enjoying the view. I also noticed that the sky was starting to turn a beautiful shade of pink and purple, signifying the onset of dusk. I decided to walk over to the edge of the tower to get a better view of the city as the sun set. As I looked out, I felt a sense of peace and wonder. It was an unforgettable experience.
