I was watching the sun set on the moon, and I felt a sense of peace and accomplishment. I knew that my work was helping to make life better for people back home. Suddenly, my peace was shattered by a loud beeping sound. My computer was telling me that there was an incoming transmission from Earth. I hurriedly opened the connection, and my boss's face appeared on the screen. He told me that there had been a major problem with the software I'd been working on, and that I needed to fix it immediately. I felt my heart sink as I realized I'd have to put my rest and relaxation on hold for a little while longer.
