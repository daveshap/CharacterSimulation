I was busy making coffee for my customers when I noticed a commotion outside. I looked out the window and saw a large crowd of people gathered around a woman who appeared to be in distress. I rushed out to see if I could help and found that the woman was pregnant and about to give birth. I and a group of bystanders helped deliver the baby and I offered the woman and her new baby a cup of coffee and a place to rest.
