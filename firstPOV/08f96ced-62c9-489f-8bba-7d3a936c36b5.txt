I was sitting on the beach, watching as the kids played in the sand and splash in the water. It was a beautiful day, and I was enjoying the peace and quiet.Suddenly, I heard a loud cry from one of the kids. I looked over and saw that one of the toddlers had fallen and was now crying. I rushed over to comfort the child and help him up. I then took him back to his parents, who were sitting nearby.
