The sun had barely peeked over the horizon when I started my shift. I had to be up early to beat the morning traffic. The city was already starting to stir as I made my way to my first job of the day. The streets were lined with cars and the sidewalk was crammed with people hurrying to their destinations. I weaved through the crowd, making my way to the apartment building where I was supposed to babysit for the day. I reached the building and pressed the button for the elevator. I rode it up to the tenth floor, where the family I was babysitting for lived. I knocked on the door and was let in by the mom. The mom handed me a list of things to do for the day and kissed her son goodbye. Then she was out the door, off to work. I was left alone with the boy, who was already getting into mischief.
