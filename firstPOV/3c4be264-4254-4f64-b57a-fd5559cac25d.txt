I slowly open my eyes, blinking in the early morning light that's streaming in through the window. I feel a bit groggy after sleeping for longer than usual, but I know I need to get moving. I slowly sit up in bed, running a hand through my disheveled hair. I swing my legs over the side of the bed and stand up, stretching my arms above my head. I stifle a yawn as I make my way over to the window, pushing aside the curtains to get a better view of the day outside. The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, and the sky is a beautiful shade of pink and orange. I can't help but smile at the sight; it's one of my favorite times of day. I glance at the clock on the nightstand and realize I'm running late. I quickly grab a pair of jeans and a shirt from my dresser and throw them on, not bothering to button up the shirt. I grab my keys and wallet from the nightstand and head for the door. As I step out into the hallway, I can hear my roommates moving around in the kitchen. I know they'll give me a hard time about sleeping in, but I can't help it. I'm just not a morning person. I make my way down the hallway and into the kitchen, where my roommates are already eating breakfast. They greet me with good-natured teasing, and I respond with a sleepy grin. I grab a piece of toast from the plate on the counter and take a seat at the table, washing down the toast with a cup of coffee. I know I'll be wide awake soon enough.
