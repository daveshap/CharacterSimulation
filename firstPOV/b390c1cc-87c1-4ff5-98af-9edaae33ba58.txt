I'm driving my truck along the beach when I see a group of people playing volleyball. I smile and keep driving. Further down the beach, I see a woman sunbathing. I can't help but stare at her for a moment. She's wearing a bikini, and she has a great body. I avert my eyes and continue driving. I eventually arrive at my destination, a small cottage by the beach. I park my truck and start to unload the boxes. I'm just about finished when I see the woman from the beach walking towards me. She's carrying a beach towel and a bottle of sunscreen. "Hi," she says. "Do you need some help with those?" I smile and nod. "Sure, thanks." Together, we finish unloading the boxes and carry them into the cottage. I can't help but feel attracted to the woman, and I can tell that she feels the same way about me. However, we both know that nothing can happen between us, so we just enjoy each other's company and go our separate ways.
