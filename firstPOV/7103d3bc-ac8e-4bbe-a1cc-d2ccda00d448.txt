I walk up the path to my cottage, feeling tired after a long day of work. I'm looking forward to relaxing in my comfortable home. As I unlock the door, I'm greeted by the warm, inviting atmosphere of the cottage. I immediately feel at ease as I step inside. The living room is cozy and inviting, with a fire crackling in the fireplace. I head to the kitchen to pour myself a glass of wine. As I sip my wine, I look out the window at the tranquil setting. I can see the ducks swimming in the pond and the flowers blooming in the garden. I take a deep breath and smile, feeling thankful for this moment of peace.
