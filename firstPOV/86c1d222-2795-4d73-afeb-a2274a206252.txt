I'm standing under the Eifel Tower, enjoying the sights and sounds of Paris. I've been here for a few days now, and have loved every minute of it. I'm wearing a light summer dress and sandals, and have a small backpack with me. I'm people watching and enjoying the atmosphere when I notice a man walking towards me. He's well-dressed and looks like he might be a tourist. He smiles at me as he gets closer, and I smile back. The man comes up to me and asks me in broken English if I know where the nearest restaurant is. I hesitated for a moment, unsure if I should help him or not. But then I remember my high school French teacher telling me that one of the best things about travel is being able to help others, so I direct the man to a nearby cafe. The man thanks me profusely and walk away. I go back to people watching and enjoying the sunny day.
