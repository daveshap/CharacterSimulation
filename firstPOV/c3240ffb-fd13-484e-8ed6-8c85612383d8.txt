I'm standing on the mountaintop, surrounded by darkness. I'm shivering in the cold, and I can see my breath in the air. I'm wearing a thin jacket, and I'm starting to feel the numbing effects of the cold. I've been walking for hours, and I'm exhausted. I'm lost, and I have no idea where I am. I've been wandering around in the dark for what seems like forever, and I'm starting to panic. Suddenly, I see a light in the distance. It's faint, but it's definitely there. I start walking towards it, and I soon realize that it's a fire. There's a group of people gathered around it, and they look warm and comfortable. I quicken my pace, and I soon reach the fire. I'm relieved to be out of the cold, and I'm happy to see other people. I've been feeling so alone, and I'm glad to have some company.
