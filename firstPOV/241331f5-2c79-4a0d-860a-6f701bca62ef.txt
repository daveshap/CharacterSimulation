The sun was high in the sky and the waves were crashing against the shore as I sat on the beach, enjoying my lunch. I had been working hard on my latest project and wanted to take a break to clear my head. The sound of the waves and the feel of the sand between my toes was just what I needed. As I sat there, I watched as a group of children played in the water, laughing and splashing around. It was a beautiful day and I was happy to be able to enjoy it.
