The sun is just peeking over the horizon as I hurry to catch my train to work. I'm wearing a tailored navy suit and carrying a laptop bag over my shoulder. The streets are still relatively empty at this hour, but I know that won't last long. I quicken my pace, crossing the street and darting down an alleyway that will take me to the train station. I can hear the sound of traffic starting to build up on the main streets and the occasional honk of a horn. The fresh morning air feels good as I walk, and I can't help but feel a sense of excitement for the day ahead. I've been working on a new project at the office and am anxious to get started on it. As I round the corner into the train station, I spot my train pulling in. I quicken my pace even more, sprinting towards the platform. I make it just in time, leaping onto the train as the doors are closing. I find a seat and settle in for the ride, my mind already starting to race with ideas for the project.
