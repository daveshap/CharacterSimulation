The sun is setting over the city as I push a stroller down the sidewalk. I'm on my way to the park to meet my friend, Mia. The streets are busy with people heading home from work or out to dinner. I wave to a few familiar faces as I pass by. The park is lit up by the last of the day's sunlight. I can see Mia sitting on a bench, waiting for me. I quicken my pace, eager to chat with her. As I get closer, I see that Mia has someone with her. I slow down, not sure if I should intrude. Mia sees me and calls out, "Gabbi! Come meet my new boyfriend, Luke." I smile and approach the bench. "Nice to meet you, Luke." Luke stands up and shakes my hand. "Likewise. Mia has told me so much about you." I laugh. "I hope she's been saying good things." Mia linked her arm through Luke's. "Of course I have. Gabbi is the best babysitter in the city." I blush with pleasure. "Well, I better get going. It was nice meeting you, Luke." "You too, Gabbi. Maybe we'll see you around sometime." I wave goodbye as I continue on my way. I'm happy to see her friend so happy, but I can't help feeling a little jealous. It feels like everyone is moving on with their lives while I'm stuck in the same old routine.
