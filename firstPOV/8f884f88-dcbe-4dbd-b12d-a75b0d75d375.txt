I'm driving my delivery truck slowly down a dusty road. I'm sweating profusely, and the setting sun is making it difficult to see. I'm surrounded by tall grass and scrubby bushes. Suddenly, I see a movement in the grass to my left and I slam on the brakes. My heart is pounding as I try to see what it is. A moment later, a gazelle leaps out from the grass and dart across the road in front of the truck. I exhale in relief and continue on my way.
