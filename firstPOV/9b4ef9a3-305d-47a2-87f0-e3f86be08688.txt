I'm Tom, a bartender, and I'm working in a busy bar in a bright city in the middle of the night. I'm wearing a white shirt and black pants, and I have a black apron around my waist. My hair is combed back and I have a small mustache. I'm smiling as I serve the customers. I'm happy to be working in a busy bar.
