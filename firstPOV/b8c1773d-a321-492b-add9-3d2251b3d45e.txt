I'm out for a walk at dusk, enjoying the quiet of the evening. The sky is a deep blue, and the stars are just beginning to come out. I feel a sense of peace and calm as I walk. Suddenly, I hear a noise behind me. I turn to see a large, furry creature standing there. The creature is menacing, and I feel scared. I start to back away, but the creature starts to come towards me. I start to run, but the creature is faster. It catches up to me and knocks me to the ground. I feel a sharp pain in my leg and look down to see the creature's teeth sunk into my flesh. I scream for help, but nobody comes. The creature starts to drag me away. I know I am going to die. I think of my husband and children and how much I love them. Suddenly, the creature is hit by a beam of light. It drops me and falls to the ground, dead. I look up to see a spaceship overhead. A voice comes over the loudspeaker, telling me that I have been rescued. I am taken aboard the spaceship and given medical treatment. I am safe now, but I will never forget the terror of that night on the moon.
