I enter my bedroom and immediately begin to undress. I start with my shirt, pulling it off my head and throwing it onto the bed. Next, I unbutton my pants and shimmies out of them, leaving them in a heap on the floor. I walk to the bed and climb in, pulling the covers up to my chest. I stare up at the ceiling, lost in thought. After a few minutes, I hear a noise from the other room. It sounds like someone is moving around in the kitchen. I know that my roommate, Sarah, is home from her night shift at the hospital. She must be getting something to eat. I hesitate for a moment, wondering if I should say something to her. But I decide against it and quietly go back to bed.
