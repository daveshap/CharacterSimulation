As I drive my truck through the lunar landscape, I can see the craters and mountains in the distance. I'm getting closer to my destination. The delivery site is a small, isolated base on the side of a mountain. There are no lights or signs of life. I pull up to the base and get out of my truck. I look around and see no one. I begin to unload the boxes of supplies from my truck. Suddenly, I hear a noise. Someone is coming. I hide behind a box and wait. A figure appears in the darkness. It is a human. The person is wearing a space suit and carrying a rifle. The figure approaches me and points the rifle at me. I am terrified. The figure speaks in a voice that is distorted by the helmet. "What are you doing here?" I am too scared to speak. The figure repeats the question. I finally respond. "I'm just making a delivery." The figure lowers the rifle. "Sorry, I thought you were someone else. I'm the base commander. Welcome to the moon."
