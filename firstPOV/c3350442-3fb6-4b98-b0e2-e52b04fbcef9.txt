The sun is setting as I make my way through the dense forest. I've been walking for hours, and my feet are starting to feel sore. I take a break to rest against a tree, and look around me. The forest is eerily quiet, and the only sound is the leaves rustling in the breeze. I don't know how I got here. The last thing I remember is leaving my coffee shop to go on a delivery. I don't know how long I've been walking, but I know I need to find a way out of the forest. I get up and start walking again, but I don't get far before I hear a branch snap. I freeze in my tracks and listen carefully. There it is again. Something is definitely following me. I start to run, but I'm tripped by a roots and fall to the ground. I look up just in time to see a large, furry creature standing over me. I scream as the creature sinks its teeth into my neck.
