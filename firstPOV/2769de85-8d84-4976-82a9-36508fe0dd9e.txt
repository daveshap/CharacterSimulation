I enter the bedroom and take a look around. My eyes settle on the bed in the corner, and I approach it. I pick up a pillow and sniff it, then set it back down. I then move to the window and look outside. I see the city skyline, and the many lights twinkling in the distance. I sigh and turn back to the room. I begin to unbutton my shirt, revealing a sweaty and tired body. I take off my shirt and pants and climb into the bed. I let out a long sigh and close my eyes, soon falling asleep.
