I was walking through the forest, minding my own business, when I heard a noise in the bushes. I drew my knife and approached cautiously. Suddenly, a group of men jumped out from behind the bushes, yelling and brandishing clubs. I tried to run, but they quickly caught up to me and began to beat me. I fell to the ground, unconscious. The men took my knife and wallet, and then disappeared back into the forest.
