I was walking along the sidewalk in the city, carrying a baby in my arms. It was evening and the city was brightly lit. I was wearing a babysitter uniform and I was late for my babysitting job. As I walked, I noticed a group of teenagers loitering on the corner. I tried to avoid them, but they called out to me. "Hey, babysitter! Come over here!" I ignored them and continued walking, but they followed me. "Come on, babysitter, we just want to talk to you." I quickened my pace, but they continued to follow me. Finally, I reached my destination and ran up to the door, banging on it frantically. The teenager catch up to me and grab my arm. "Let me go! I have to babysit!" The teenager laugh and begin to drag me away. I screamed for help, but no one came. I was abducted by the teenagers and taken to an unknown location.
