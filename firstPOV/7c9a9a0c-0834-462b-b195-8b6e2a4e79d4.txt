I was sound asleep in my bed when I suddenly woke up. I had no idea what woke me up, but I knew I needed to check on my kids. I quietly got out of bed, careful not to wake my husband, and tiptoed to my children's bedroom. Peeking inside, I saw that all was well and my kids were fast asleep. I breathed a sigh of relief and went back to bed. But just as I was about to drift off to sleep, I heard a noise coming from downstairs. Cautiously, I got out of bed again and crept downstairs. I very slowly opened the door to the living room and was shocked to see a burglar rummaging through my things! In a split second, I knew I needed to act. I quietly grabbed a vase and sneaked up on the burglar, whacking him over the head with it. The burglar crumpled to the ground, unconscious. I quickly grabbed my phone and called the police. Within minutes, they arrived and arrested the burglar. I was shaken, but relieved that my family was safe.
