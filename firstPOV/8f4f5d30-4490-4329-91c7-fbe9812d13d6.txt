I've been sitting on the beach for hours, watching the sun set. I'm getting cold, but I don't want to leave this peaceful spot. I've been through a lot lately. I just graduated from high school, and I'm not sure what I want to do with my life. I've been thinking about taking a gap year, but my parents are pressuring me to go to college. I'm not sure what I want to study, or even if I want to go to college at all. My mind is racing as I watch the sun set. I'm thinking about my future, and I'm feeling lost. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do next.
