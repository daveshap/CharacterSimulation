I was tending to the bar when I heard a knock at the door. I went to answer it and found a beautiful woman standing before me. She introduced herself as Sarah and said she was looking for a place to stay for the night. I told her she was welcome to stay at the cottage and showed her to a room. Sarah was tired from her journey and went to lie down. I got her a glass of water and left her to rest. As I was walking back to the bar, I heard a scream coming from Sarah's room. I ran to her and found her lying on the floor in a pool of blood. I quickly called for help, but it was too late. Sarah had been stabbed to death.
