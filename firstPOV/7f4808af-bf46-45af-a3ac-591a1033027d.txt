I'm walking through the forest, looking for a place to set up my coffee shop. I've been walking for hours, and I'm getting tired. I'm also getting a bit worried, because I'm not sure how much farther I have to go. I'm getting ready to give up and turn back when I see a clearing up ahead. I walk towards it, and sure enough, there is a coffee shop there. I'm relieved and happy to have found the place. I walk up to the shop and go inside. The shop is empty, and it looks like it hasn't been used in a long time. I look around, and I see a coffee pot on the counter. I walk over to it and start to make some coffee. Suddenly, I hear a noise outside. I freeze, and I listen carefully. It sounds like someone is coming. I hide behind the counter and wait. The person comes into the shop, and I can see that it's a woman. She's carrying a gun, and she looks around the shop cautiously. I stay hidden and watch as the woman goes over to the coffee pot and starts to make some coffee. After a few minutes, the woman relaxes and puts her gun down. She takes a cup of coffee and sits down at a table. I wait for a few minutes, and then I come out from behind the counter. I walk over to the woman and sit down at the table with her. We start to talk, and I soon learn that the woman is a professional bounty hunter. She's been hired to find me and bring me back to the United States. I'm surprised, but I'm not scared. I know that I'm innocent, and I'm confident that I can prove it. I tell the bounty hunter my story, and she listens carefully. At the end of my story, the bounty hunter tells me that she believes me. She says that she's going to help me clear my name. I'm relieved and happy to have someone on my side.
