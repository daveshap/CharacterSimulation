I'm Wang, a delivery driver, and I've just arrived at my destination: a mountaintop in Europe. It's 6pm, and the sun is beginning to set. I set down my load and look around, admiring the view. I'm about to begin my descent when I hear a noise behind me. Turning around, I see a large, furry creature standing on the edge of the cliff, looking at me. The creature seems to be considering whether or not to approach. After a moment, it decides to come closer. I back away slowly, not wanting to startle the creature. I've never seen anything like it before. The creature comes closer and sniffles at me, then nudges me with its nose. I stroke the creature's fur, thankful that it doesn't seem to be aggressive. Suddenly, the creature moves away from me and looks back down the mountain. I follow its gaze and see a group of people coming up the path. The creature seems to be waiting for them. As the group gets closer, I can see that they are all wearing brightly colored clothing and have paint on their faces. They stop when they see me and the creature, and they all bow. The creature seems to be some sort of spirit or god, and the group is here to worship it. I wonder if I should leave, but I decide to stay and watch. I've never seen anything like this before, and I don't want to miss it. The group starts to dance and sing, and the creature joins in. I feel like I am witnessing something special and magical. I'm happy that I decided to stay.
