I was sitting in the forest, enjoying my lunch break, when I suddenly heard a noise in the bushes. I froze, listening intently. It sounded like someone, or something, was coming closer. I slowly reached into my pocket for my knife, my heart pounding in my chest. The bushes parted, and I found myself face to face with a large, furry creature. It was a monkey! The monkey stared at me for a moment, then reached out and snatched the sandwich right out of my hand. I was so surprised that I dropped my knife. The monkey sat on the tree trunk and began to eat the sandwich, watching me the whole time. I was too shocked to move. After a few moments, I slowly reached for my knife and stood up. The monkey jumped down and ran off into the forest, disappearing from sight. I was shaking as I walked back to the grocery store. I'd never seen anything like that before, and I wasn't sure what to make of it.
