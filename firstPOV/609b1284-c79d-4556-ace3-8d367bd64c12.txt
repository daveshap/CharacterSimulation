I sit on a bench under the Eifel Tower, eating my lunch and watching as the tourists pass by. I people-watch for a while, enjoying the diverse mix of people from all over the world who are all here to see this iconic landmark. After a while, I check my phone and realize that it's time to pick up my charge, a little girl named Emma, from school. I finish my lunch and head off to get Emma.
