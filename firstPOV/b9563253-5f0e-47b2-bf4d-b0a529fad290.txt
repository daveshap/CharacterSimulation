I'm driving down a dirt road leading to a small country cottage. The sun is shining and the birds are chirping as I approach the cute little house. I park my truck and get out, admiring the beautiful flowers blooming around the front porch. I climb the steps and knock on the door, waiting for a moment before it opens. A woman with graying hair and a kind face answers the door. She smiles at me and invites me in. I step into the cozy living room and she leads me to a seat. She asks me what brings me there and I tell her I'm looking for work. She says she's been needing someone to help her with some odd jobs around the property and I agree to do it. She shows me what needs to be done and I go to work. I start by trimming the hedges around the perimeter of the property. I then mow the lawn and do some weeding in the flower beds. After a few hours of work, I've completed everything on her list. I pack up my tools and say goodbye to the woman, telling her I'll come back tomorrow to finish up.
