I'm driving my delivery truck through a dark forest in South America. I'm on a winding dirt road and the trees are so thick that I can barely see the sky. Suddenly, I come around a bend and see a large, furry creature blocking the road. I slam on the brakes and the truck skids to a stop. The creature is standing on its hind legs and is taller than the truck. It has long, sharp claws and is glaring at me with its bright eyes. My heart is racing and I am terrified. I do not know what to do. The creature takes a step towards the truck and I frantically try to think of a way to escape. Suddenly, I have an idea. I open the door of the truck and try to drive away, but the creature is too fast. It grabs the truck with its claws and flips it over. I am thrown from the truck and hit my head on a rock. I am unconscious. The creature drags my unconscious body into the woods and begins to eat me. I am unaware of what is happening as I am being devoured by the creature.
