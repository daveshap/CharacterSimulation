I was strolling through Paris on a beautiful day, admiring the view as I walked past the Eiffel Tower. I stopped to really take in the sight, and as I looked up at the towering structure, I noticed a young couple kissing in the shadows. They looked so happy and in love. I sighed and continued on my way. I had always wanted to find love like that. I had been searching for my soulmate for years, but hadn't had any luck. Maybe one day I would find my own special someone. But for now, I was content working as a bartender and enjoying the simple things in life.
