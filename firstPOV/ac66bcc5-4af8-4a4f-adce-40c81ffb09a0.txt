I'm Aleksy, a grocery store clerk on the moon. I'm working at the store today, stocking shelves and chatting with customers. I'm wearing a blue uniform with a name tag that says "Aleksy." I have a kind face and I'm always polite to the customers. The store is busy today, as it is every day. It's the only store on the moon and the only place to buy groceries. The store is well-lit and clean, with aisles of food and supplies. There are people of all ages and types shopping here. I pause to talk to a customer who is looking for a specific type of cheese. I help her find it and then I go back to stocking shelves. I'm happy to be able to help people and to be doing a job I enjoy.
