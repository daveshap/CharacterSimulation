I was just finishing up my shift at the bar when I heard a commotion coming from one of the offices down the hall. I couldn't make out what was being said, but it sounded like someone was in a lot of pain. I knew I shouldn't get involved, but I couldn't just ignore it. I slowly made my way down the hall towards the office, trying to stay out of sight. As I got closer, I could hear a man's voice, high-pitched and panicked. I peeked into the office and saw a man lying on the floor, clutching his chest. It was clear he was having a heart attack. I knew I needed to act fast. I raced into the office and kneeled down next to the man. I could see that he wasn't breathing and his skin was starting to turn blue. I realized I needed to perform CPR. I'd never done it before, but I knew I couldn't just stand there and do nothing. I started compressions, counting out loud as I went. I breathed into the man's mouth and continued the compressions. Suddenly, the man started coughing and gasping for air. I had saved his life. The man was obviously shaken and very grateful. I helped him to his feet and helped him back to his office. I called 911 to make sure the man got the medical attention he needed. I knew I'd done a good thing, but I was also feeling shaken up. It had been a long day, and this was definitely not what I was expecting when I came to work.
