I enter my bedroom and look around. The room is tidy, but there are toys scattered on the floor and clothes thrown over a chair. I sigh and begin to pick up the toys. As I bend down to pick up a doll, I notice a book wedged under the bed. I crawl under the bed to retrieve it and dust it off. The book is old and worn, but the title is still legible: "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer." I smile and open the book. I begin to read the book, but I am soon interrupted by the sound of my young son crying. I put the book down and go to comfort him.
