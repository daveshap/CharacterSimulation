I'm walking along the path, tired and fatigued from a long day of work. I hear a strange noise emanating from the darkness ahead of me. It sounds like something is moving through the underbrush, and it is getting closer. I begin to feel uneasy, and I quicken my pace. Suddenly, something leaps out at me from the shadows, and I let out a scream as I am tackled to the ground.
