I'm in the middle of the mosh pit, surrounded by sweaty, lively people. I'm throwing my hands in the air and singing along to the music, letting myself get lost in the moment. I'm bumping into other people and don't care, I'm just enjoying the music and the feeling of being surrounded by like-minded people.
