As I approached the Eiffel Tower, I began to hear a strange noise. It sounded like someone was crying. I started to feel scared and wanted to turn back, but I knew I had to make the delivery. As I got closer to the tower, I saw a figure crouched under the structure. It was a woman, and she appeared to be crying. I approached her cautiously and asked if she was okay. The woman looked up at me with tears in her eyes and shook her head. She then began to tell me her story. She explained that her name was Sophie and that she was from Paris. She came to visit the Eiffel Tower with her boyfriend, but they got into a big fight and he left her here. She had been there for hours, and she was scared and didn't know what to do. I felt sorry for Sophie and wanted to help her. I offered to call her a cab so she could go home. Sophie was hesitant at first, but then she agreed. I helped her to her feet and flagged down a cab. I gave the driver Sophie's address and then watched as the cab drove away.
