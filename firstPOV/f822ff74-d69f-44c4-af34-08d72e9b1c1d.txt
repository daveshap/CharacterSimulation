I was just finishing up sweeping the floors when I heard a loud commotion outside. I peeked out the window and saw a group of people walking quickly down the street, heading in my direction. I quickly turned off the lights in the store and hurried to the back room, hoping they wouldn't notice me. I could hear them now, shouting and smashing things as they came closer. I hid under the desk in the back room and waited, my heart pounding in my chest. The door to the store burst open and I could hear them walking around, smashing things and throwing things. I was terrified that they would find me, but I didn't dare move. After what seemed like forever, they finally left and I cautiously emerged from my hiding spot. The store was a mess, but luckily they hadn't found me. I sighed in relief and started to clean up the mess, trying to forget the terrifying experience.
