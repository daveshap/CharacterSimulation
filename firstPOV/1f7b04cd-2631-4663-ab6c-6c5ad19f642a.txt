I can see the sun just peeking over the horizon as I open up my coffee shop. I've got a big day ahead, as I'm catering the breakfast shift for a big concert happening in the park across the street. I've been up for hours already, getting everything ready, and I know I won't have a chance to sit down until it's all over. I can hear the music already, even though the concert won't start for another few hours. The park is already starting to fill up with people, and I know it's going to be a long day. But I'm happy to be a part of it, and I know my coffee will help keep everyone going. I'm just getting everything set up when I hear a shout from outside. I know that voice - it's my old friend, Joe. Joe is one of the security guards for the concert, and he's come to get my help. Apparently, there's been a mix-up with the catering order, and they're short a lot of coffee. I quickly grab a bunch of my coffee beans and start grinding them, getting ready to make a massive pot of coffee. I know it's going to be a long day, but I'm happy to help out my friends. And I know that, at the end of it all, there will be a great concert to enjoy.
