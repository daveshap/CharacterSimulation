I'm standing under the Eiffel Tower, gazing up at it in wonder. I've never seen anything like it before, and I'm awestruck by its size and beauty. I can hear the hustle and bustle of the city around me, but it feels like a million miles away. I'm lost in the moment, imagining what it must have been like to build something so incredible.
