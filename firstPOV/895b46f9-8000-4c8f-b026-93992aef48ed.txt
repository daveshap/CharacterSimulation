I was enjoying a smoke break under the Eiffel Tower when I suddenly heard a loud noise. I looked up to see a large object falling from the top of the tower. I realized it was a person and started to run, but it was too late. The person hit the ground with a thud, narrowly missing me. I was horrified and started to tremble. I looked around to see if anyone else saw what happened, but no one was around. I decided to go back to the grocery store and pretend like nothing happened.
