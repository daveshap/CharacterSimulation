I'm hard at work on the lunar surface, putting the finishing touches on a new construction project. The sun is setting, and the air is growing colder. I'm starting to feel tired, but I know I have to finish the job before I can call it a day. Suddenly, I hear a noise in the distance. It sounds like someone is crying. I'm curious, so I follow the sound. I come to a small crater, and in the bottom of it, I see a little girl. She's crying and shivering, and she's all alone. I know I can't leave her there, so I climb down into the crater and scoop her up in my arms. I carry her back to the construction site, where I build her a little bed out of some spare materials. I wrap her in a blanket and tuck her in. The little girl is asleep in no time. I watch over her all night, making sure she's safe and warm. In the morning, I take her back to her home. This act of kindness is just another day on the job for me.
