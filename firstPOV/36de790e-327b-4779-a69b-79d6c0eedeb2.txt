As soon as I enter my cottage, I'm hit with the smell of lunch cooking. I hang up my jacket and hat on the rack by the door and wash my hands in the sink. Then I head to the kitchen to check on lunch. I give the pot on the stove a quick stir and take a peek in the oven. Satisfied that everything is on track, I go to set the table. I pull out plates and silverware from the cupboard and arrange them on the table. Then I go to the fridge and grab a pitcher of iced tea and a platter of sandwiches. I set them in the middle of the table and take a seat. A few minutes later, my wife Sarah enters the cottage. She gives me a quick kiss on the cheek and takes a seat at the table. The two of us chat as we enjoy our lunch.
