I slowly rub my eyes and then slowly get out of bed. My feet touch the cold floor and I shiver. I slowly walk to the window and open the curtains. The sun is just starting to rise, and the sky is a beautiful orange color. I stand there for a moment, taking in the sight. I then turn and walk to my closet, where I pull out a pair of jeans and a shirt. I quickly get dressed and then walk to my dresser, where I grab a hairbrush and start to brush my hair. After a few minutes, I am done and I put the brush back down. I then walk to the door of my bedroom and open it. I step out into the hallway and start to make my way to the kitchen.
