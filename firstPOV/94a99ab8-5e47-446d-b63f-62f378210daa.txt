I'm Wang, a delivery driver for the lunar base. It's 6pm and my shift is almost over. I'm about to deliver a package to the last address on my route. I arrive at the address, a small dome on the edge of the base. I knock on the door and am greeted by a women. She takes the package and thanks me. I'm about to leave when I notice something strange. There is a light coming from inside the dome that shouldn't be there. I decide to investigate. I enter the dome and immediately notice that the walls are covered in a strange pink goo. I also see that the woman is slumped over in a chair, apparently unconscious. I rush to the woman's side to see if she is okay. I find that she is still alive, but barely. She is mumbling something about "the pink goo." I realize that I need to get help. I run back to the base to get help.
