I cautiously enter the dark Forest, stepping over fallen branches and sidestepping mud puddles. I've never been here before, and my heart pounds in my chest as I hear strange noises all around me. I tell myself to be brave -- I've come here on a mission, and I can't turn back now. My eyes adjust to the darkness, and I start to make out the shapes of trees and bushes around me. Suddenly, something moves in the bushes ahead of me, and I gasp. I raise my flashlight, but before I can see what it is, there's a loud rustling and the creature is gone. My heart is pounding so hard I can barely breathe, but I force myself to keep going. I've been walking for what feels like hours, but I know I can't be far from my destination. I emerge into a small clearing and see a faint light flickering in the distance. I start to breathe a little easier -- I must be getting close. I walk towards the light, and as I get closer, I see that it's coming from a small cave. I hesitate for a moment, but I know I have to go in. I take a deep breath and enter the cave. The light is coming from a fire in the center of the cave, and I can see people gathered around it. They're all dressed in strange clothes, and they're chanting in a language I don't understand. When they see me, they stop chanting and stare at me. I'm not sure what to do, but before I can say anything, the ground starts to shake. The people around the fire start to panicked, and I hear someone yell, "The prophecy is coming true! She's here!"
