The sun was just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a soft pink and orange glow across the landscape. I woke up slowly, yawning and stretching as I sat up in my sleeping bag. I rubbed my eyes sleepily, taking in my surroundings. I was camping in the middle of nowhere in Africa, and the silence was deafening. I got up and grabbed my water bottle, taking a long drink before rummaging through my backpack for some breakfast. I munched on a granola bar as I stared out at the vastness of the plains before me. I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the natural beauty of my surroundings. Suddenly, I heard a loud noise coming from the other side of the camp. I grabbed my camera and started to creep towards the sound, curiosity getting the better of me. I peeked around a tree to see a group of elephants, trumpeting and shuffling around in the mud. I snapped a few pictures before cautiously approaching the animals. I was absolutely fascinated by them. I watched them for a while, before finally packing up my things and heading back on the long journey home. I knew I would never forget this incredible experience.
