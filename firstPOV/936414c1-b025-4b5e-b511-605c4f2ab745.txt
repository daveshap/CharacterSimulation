I'm sitting on the beach, watching the sun rise. The sky is awash in a beautiful orange glow, and the waves are crashing against the shore. I'm wrapped in a light blanket, and I feel peaceful and happy. I've been thinking a lot lately about what I want to do with my life, and I've decided that I want to travel the world. I'm not sure how I'll make it happen, but I'm determined to find a way. Sitting here on the beach, watching the sun rise, I feel like anything is possible.
