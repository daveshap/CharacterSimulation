I'm sitting on a mountaintop in Europe, in the middle of the night. I'm wearing a white gown and have a small group of people with me. I'm chanting and holding a crystal in my hand. The crystal is glowing brightly. My eyes are closed and I seem to be in a trance. The people with me are also chanting. We are all facing the same direction, towards the east.
