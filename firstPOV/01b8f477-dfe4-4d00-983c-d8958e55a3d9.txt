I was driving my delivery truck across the surface of the moon when I saw something in the road ahead of me. I slowed down, and as I got closer, I saw that it was a person. The person was lying in the road, and they didn't appear to be moving. I got out of my truck to see if the person was okay. I could see that they were wearing a spacesuit, but their helmet was off. I could see that the person was not breathing. I knew that I should call for help, but I also knew that it would take hours for help to arrive. I decided to try to revive the person myself. I started CPR, and after a few minutes, the person began to breathe again. I was relieved, and I helped the person into my truck so that I could take them to the hospital.
