I'm sitting in my hut, trying to get my four children to eat their dinner. The hut is made of mud and sticks, and the only light comes from a small fire in the corner. The children are tired and hungry, and I'm doing my best to feed them. However, there is not much food, and I'm worried about how I will feed my family tomorrow.
