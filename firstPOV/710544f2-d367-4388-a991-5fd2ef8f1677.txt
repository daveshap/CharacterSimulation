I climb the last few feet to the mountaintop, gasping for breath in the thin air. I pause to rest, leaning against a boulder, and look out over the valley below. The sun is setting, and the sky is turning a deep red. I shiver and pull my jacket tighter around me. I look down at my watch and curse. I'm running late. I have to deliver a package to the monastery on the other side of the mountain, and it's already getting dark. I know the monks don't like visitors after dark, but I have no choice. I start down the path, picking my way carefully in the twilight. As I approach the monastery, I can see lights shining in the windows. I quicken my pace, but before I can reach the door, it swings open and a figure cloaked in black appears. I stop in my tracks, heart pounding. The figure beckons to me, and I hesitantly follow. I am led into the monastery, where I am greeted by the abbot. The abbot tells me that he has been expecting me. I am relieved, and the abbot leads me to the dining hall, where a warm meal is waiting. After dinner, the abbot shows me to my room and tells me to get some rest. I am tired from my long journey, and I quickly fall asleep. In the morning, I will be given the package to deliver.
