I'm walking home from my friend's house late at night. I'm alone and the streets are empty. The only sound is the clicking of my heels on the pavement. I'm walking quickly, but I'm not afraid. I know these streets like the back of my hand. I turn the corner onto my street and see a man standing in the shadows, watching me. I don't slow down or change my course. I know he's not going to hurt me. As I pass him, I can feel his eyes on me. I can sense his presence, even though he's not saying or doing anything. I know he's there, but I don't turn around. I continue walking until I reach my house. I unlock the door and go inside, safe and sound.
