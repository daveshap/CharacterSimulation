I walk up to the Eiffel Tower just as the sun is setting. The sky is a beautiful orange, and the City of Lights is just starting to twinkle. I look up at the tower, admiring its beauty for a moment, before I notice a small girl sitting on the ground, crying. I walk over to the girl and ask her what's wrong. The girl, who is about six years old, sniffles and wipes her eyes before she responds. She tells me that she got separated from her family while they were visiting the tower, and she doesn't know how to find them. I assure the little girl that I will help her find her family. I take the girl's hand and start walking around the tower, asking people if they have seen the girl's family. After a few minutes, we finally find the girl's parents, who are very relieved to be reunited with their daughter. I finish my job for the night and head home, feeling happy that I was able to help the little girl.
