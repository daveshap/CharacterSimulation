I was having such a nice time, just enjoying my lunch break on a mountaintop in Europe. The sun was shining and the view was stunning. I was happy to be surrounded by such natural beauty. But then I heard a loud noise. It sounded like an avalanche! I looked around in panic and saw a huge wall of snow coming towards me. I had no time to run. I could only watch as the avalanche engulfing me. Fortunately, I was buried alive. I was able to reach my phone and call for help. After what felt like hours, I was finally rescued. I was cold and shaken, but otherwise unharmed. This was a close call for me. I will never forget the experience of being buried alive.
