The sun is setting over the gently rolling hills of the countryside, and the last of its rays are shining through the windows of the cozy cottage I call home. Inside, I'm curled up on the sofa with my laptop, working on the latest code for my employer. I'm lost in concentration, and the only sound in the room is the soft tapping of my keyboard. Suddenly, the idyll is broken by the sound of a car pulling up outside. I pause my work, wondering who it could be at this time of day. I get up from the sofa and go to the window, peeking out from behind the curtains. I see a black sedan parked in the driveway, and two men getting out of it. They're both wearing dark suits and sunglasses, and they look like they mean business. My heart sinks as I realize they must be here for me. I quickly grab my laptop and hide it under the cushions of the sofa, then go to open the door. The men don't say anything as they push past me into the cottage, and my mind races as I wonder what they're going to do to me.
