I had always wanted to visit the Eiffel Tower. It was one of the most famous landmarks in the world, and I had always dreamed of seeing it in person. Finally, on my day off from work, I made the trip. I arrived at the tower just as the lunch crowd was starting to thin out. I walked around the base of the tower, admiring its size and marveling at the engineering feat it represented. After a few minutes, I decided to go to the top. I waited in line for the elevator, chatting with the other tourists as they waited. Finally, it was my turn to go up. I stepped into the elevator and rode it to the top, where I was treated to a stunning view of the city. I stayed up there for an hour, taking in the sights and enjoying the experience. Finally, it was time to go back down. I got back in the elevator and rode it back to the ground, where I began the walk back to my apartment.
