I was walking along the beach, my feet sinking into the warm sand with each step. I'd been walking for hours, ever since I left my hotel room in the middle of the night. I wasn't sure what had led me there, but I felt drawn to the place. The moon was high in the sky, casting a silver glow over the landscape. I could see the waves crashing against the shore, and the occasional fish jumping out of the water. I felt peaceful there, despite the darkness. Suddenly, I heard a noise behind me. I turned around, but there was nothing there. I started to walk again, but the noise came again, this time closer. I started to run, but whatever was following me was gaining ground. I could see a dark shape chasing me, and I knew I wouldn't be able to outrun it. Just as the shape was about to catch me, I woke up, panting and covered in sweat. I was relieved to find that it was only a dream, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching me.
