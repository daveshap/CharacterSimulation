I'm in my charge's bedroom, straightening up some of the toys that are strewn about. I'm humming to myself as I work when I suddenly hear a small noise from the closet. I freeze, listening carefully, but hear nothing else. After a moment's hesitation, I decide to investigate. I cross the room to the closet and slowly open the door. Peeking inside, I don't see anything at first. But then I notice a small form huddled in the corner, trying to make itself as small as possible. It's a little girl, who must have been hiding in the closet the whole time. I kneel down so I'm at the child's level and ask her what she's doing in there. The girl just looks at me with big, scared eyes and doesn't say a word. I try to reassure her that she's not in trouble, but the child still doesn't speak. Finally, I pick her up and carry her out of the closet. I sit down on the bed with the girl in my lap and stroke her hair soothingly. After a few minutes, the child begins to relax and falls asleep.
