As I arrive at the cottage, I can see the sun just starting to peek over the horizon. I unlock the door and step inside, taking a moment to appreciate the peacefulness of the place. Everything is tidy and well-kept, with a homey feel that makes me feel immediately at ease. I set down my bag and go to check on the children, finding them both fast asleep in their beds. With a smile, I go about my morning routine of getting breakfast ready and tidying up the house. Outside, the birds are singing and the flowers are just starting to bloom. It's shaping up to be a beautiful day, and I can't help but feel grateful to be able to spend it in such a lovely place.
