I'm babysitting a group of kids on a mountaintop in Europe and we're having a blast playing in the snow. I'm keeping a close eye on them, making sure they stay safe, when I suddenly hear a loud noise from the other side of the mountain. I look over and see a huge avalanche coming down towards us. I know I need to act fast. I grab the kids and start running down the mountain as fast as I can. The avalanche is gaining on us, but I'm determined to get the kids to safety. I manage to make it to the bottom of the mountain just in time, and the children are safe. Whew! That was a close one!
