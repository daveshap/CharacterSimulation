As I drive my delivery truck up the narrow, winding mountain road, I can't help but stare at the beautiful castle perched atop a rocky outcropping. It's an imposing structure, and it fills me with a sense of dread. I shake it off and continue on, arriving at the castle gates a few minutes later. I climb down and open them, then drive the truck through. A moment later, I'm standing in front of the castle, looking up at its towering facade. I knock on the door, but there's no answer. I knock again, louder this time, but still there's no response. I begin to feel uneasy. I look around, but there's no one in sight. I decide to leave and come back later. As I turn to go, I see a movement in one of the castle windows. I freeze, heart pounding, but there is no further movement. I tell myself it was just my imagination and back away from the castle slowly. I get back in my truck and drive down the mountain, never once looking back.
