The sun is beating down on me, and I'm crammed together with a bunch of other people in the concert venue. I'm standing near the back, trying to get a glimpse of the stage. I'm sweating in the heat, and I can feel the sticky beer spilling down my arm from the plastic cup I'm holding. The music is so loud that it's making my head throb, but I'm enjoying watching the people around me dancing and singing along. Every now and then, someone bumps into me and I have to steady myself to keep from being knocked over. I'm getting a little claustrophobic, but I don't want to leave before the concert is over.
