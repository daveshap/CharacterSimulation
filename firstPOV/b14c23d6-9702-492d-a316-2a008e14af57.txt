I'm standing on the mountaintop, gazing out at the sunset. The sky is a beautiful orange, and the mountains in the distance are a deep blue. The air is cool and fresh, and I can hear the sound of birds chirping in the distance. I feel a sense of peace and calm. Suddenly, I hear a loud noise behind me. I turn around and see a group of construction workers, who are busy at work building a new structure. They are Noise, and the sound of their work echoes through the mountains. I watch the workers for a few minutes, before turning back to the sunset. I am filled with a sense of wonder and happiness, and I know that this is a moment I will always remember.
