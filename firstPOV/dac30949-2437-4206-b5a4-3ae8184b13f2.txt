I'm a delivery driver who's currently stopped at a red light in a busy city. I'm surrounded by tall buildings and there's a steady stream of traffic passing by. I'm wearing a uniform and have a delivery bag in the passenger seat. I'm waiting for the light to turn green so I can continue on my route.
