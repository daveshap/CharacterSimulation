As the sun sets over the African plains, I'm getting ready for my evening meal. I've been out all day collecting firewood and water, and now I'm ready to relax and cook my dinner. I have a small fire going in my cooking pot, and I'm adding some vegetables that I gathered from my garden. As I cook, I hear the sound of lions roaring in the distance. I know they're far away, but it still makes me feel a little uneasy. After I eat my dinner, I take a few minutes to enjoy the sunset before going to bed.
