As I approach my cottage, I can see the warm glow of the lights inside. I can't wait to relax after a long day. As I enter, I am enveloped in the comforting smells of home cooking. My husband and children are gathered around the table, and they all smile when they see me. After a delicious meal and some quality family time, I retire to my bedroom for a well-deserved rest. I slip into my PJs and climb into bed, feeling thankful for my happy life.
