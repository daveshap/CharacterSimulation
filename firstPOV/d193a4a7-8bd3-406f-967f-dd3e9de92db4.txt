The sun rises over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow over the Paris skyline. I stand under the Eiffel Tower, looking up at the majestic structure. I've been dreaming of visiting this city for years, and now I'm finally here. I take a deep breath and savor the moment. My parents had planned to take me on a European tour after I graduated high school, but sadly, they passed away before they could make the trip. I was determined to see the places my parents had always wanted to take me, and so I saved up my own money and took the trip myself. Standing under the Eiffel Tower, I feel like anything is possible. I can't wait to explore the rest of the city and see all the sights. I know my parents would be proud of me for making this trip.
