I'm sitting on the porch of the village hut, keeping an eye on the sleeping children inside. I'm wrapped in a blanket against the chill of the night, and my head is nodding involuntarily as I try to stay awake. Suddenly, there is a sound in the bushes, and I'm alert again. I peer into the darkness, trying to see what is there. I'm just about to call out for help when a figure steps out from the shadows. I feel a relief when I see that it is only the village elder, coming to check on the children. The elder gives me a reassuring smile, before patting me on the shoulder and walking back into the night. I settle back down, my eyes once again drooping shut as I try to stay awake.
