I stood at the edge of the mountaintop, gazing out at the vast landscape before me. The moonlight cast a eerie glow over the scene, and I could just make out the outline of the mountains in the distance. A cold wind blew through the air, and I wrapped my coat tightly around myself. I had always wanted to see the Alps, and now I was finally here. I had arrived in Europe a few days ago, and I had been exploring the area ever since. I had visited a few small towns and villages, but this was the first time I had ventured into the mountains. I had seen pictures of the Alps before, but they didn't do them justice. The real thing was so much more impressive. I was about to turn and head back to my hotel when I heard a noise behind me. I spun around, but there was nothing there. The wind must have blown a branch or something, I thought. But then I heard the noise again, and this time I was sure it was coming from the other side of the mountain. I started to feel uneasy. I knew I shouldn't be out here in the middle of the night by myself. But I was curious to see what was making the noise. I carefully made my way down the side of the mountain, using my hands to help me balance. I was getting closer and closer to the noise, and I was starting to get a bad feeling about it. Finally, I came to a small clearing and saw what was making the noise. There was a large, furry creature standing in the middle of the clearing, and it was making a strange noise. I had never seen anything like it before. The creature suddenly noticed me, and it let out a loud roar. I was so startled that I fell backwards, tumbling down the side of the mountain. I hit my head on a rock and everything went black.
