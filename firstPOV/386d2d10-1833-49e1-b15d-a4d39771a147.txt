I'm walking through a dark forest in South America, my heart pounding in my chest. I've been walking for hours, and I'm starting to feel lost. I know I need to find my way out soon, before it gets dark. Suddenly, I hear a noise in the distance. It sounds like somebody is following me. I start to run, but I'm not sure which way to go. The noise gets louder and closer, and I can see somebody running after me. I'm about to scream when I trip and fall to the ground. The next thing I know, I'm being dragged off into the woods by somebody. I try to fight, but it's no use. I'm gagged and tied up, and I can't see where I'm being taken. I'm terrified, and I have no idea what's going to happen to me.
