I've been walking for hours - it feels like days. I haven't seen the light of day since I started walking, and my feet are blistered and sore. My throat is dry and I'm starving - I haven't eaten in days. I seem to be walking in circles. I sit down on a tree stump to rest, and before long I'm asleep. I'm woken up by a rustling in the bushes and I jump to my feet, knife in hand. But when the small animal emerges from the undergrowth, I relax and put my knife away. I scoop up the animal and keep walking, hoping to find my way out of the forest soon.
