The sky is a deep orange, and the sun is just beginning to dip below the horizon. The waves are crashing gently against the shore, and the salty smell of the ocean is in the air. I'm sitting on the beach, watching as the kids I'm babysitting play in the sand. They are laughing and having a good time, and I'm enjoying just taking a moment to relax.
