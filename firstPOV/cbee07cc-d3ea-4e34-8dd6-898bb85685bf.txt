I was enjoying a quiet lunch on a mountaintop in Europe when I heard a loud noise. I turned to see a large boulder tumbling down the mountain towards me. I had just enough time to dive out of the way before it crashed down, narrowly avoiding being crushed. I was shaken but uninjured. I looked up to see a group of climbers descending the mountain. One of them had lost their footing and their rope was dragging them down. I knew I had to act fast if I wanted to save them. I grabbed a nearby tree and swung out over the edge of the cliff. I grabbed the rope and started to pull the climber to safety. The climber was grateful and I was hailed as a hero.
