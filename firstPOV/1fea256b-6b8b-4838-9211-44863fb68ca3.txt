I'm standing on the beach, watching the sun set. I'm wearing a delivery uniform and holding a package. I look around, taking in the quiet beauty of the scene. I feel a sense of peace here, away from the noise and bustle of the city. I remember the first time I came to this beach. I had just started working as a delivery driver, and I was exhausted from the long hours. I had taken a wrong turn and ended up here, and I had fallen asleep on the sand. When I woke up, I was amazed by the view. I've been coming back ever since. I gazes at the horizon, admiring the colors of the sky. I take a deep breath of the salty air and feel my muscles relax. This is my favorite time of day.
