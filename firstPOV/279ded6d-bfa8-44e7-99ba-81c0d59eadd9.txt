I'm driving my truck through a dark forest in South America. I'm getting close to my destination, but I'm having a hard time seeing the road ahead of me. It's getting dark, and the headlights of my truck aren't doing a good job of lighting up the way. Suddenly, I see a figure in the road ahead of me. I slam on the brakes, but it's too late. I hit the figure, and it falls to the ground. I jump out of my truck to see what I've hit. It's a young woman. She's lying on the ground, not moving. I can see that she's badly injured. I know that I need to get help for her, but I'm not sure what to do. I decide to try to call for help on my cell phone. But when I try to make a call, I get no signal. I'm in a remote area of the forest, and there's no way to get help. I know that the woman is going to die if I don't do something. I make a decision. I pick her up and put her in the back of my truck. I'll take her to the nearest town and get help for her. I drive as fast as I can through the dark Forest. I finally arrive in the town. I take the woman to the local hospital and get her the help she needs. The woman survives, and I'm hailed as a hero.
