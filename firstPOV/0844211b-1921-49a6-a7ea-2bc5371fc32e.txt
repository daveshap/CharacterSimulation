I lazily wake up from my bed, checking the time on my phone. I realize I've slept in a bit too late and need to hurry if I want to make it to lunch on time. I quickly grab my work clothes and throw them on, not bothering to check if they're wrinkled or not. I grab my lunch pail and rush out the door, making sure to lock it behind me. I jog down the stairs of my apartment complex and make my way towards the construction site. I can see my co-workers already hard at work and know I'm going to be in for a scolding from the boss. I pick up the pace, but am still a few minutes late. When I finally reach the construction site, my boss is already there, waiting for me. I hang my head in shame as I am scolded and told to get to work. I hurry over to my station and start working, trying to make up for lost time.
