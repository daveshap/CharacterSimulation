I'm in my bedroom, getting ready for my shift at the bar. I'm wearing my black bartender uniform and I'm putting on my shoes. My hair is slicked back, and I have a fresh shave. I grab my keys and wallet and head out the door. As I walk to the bar, I think about the earlier fight I had with my girlfriend. I know I need to apologize to her, but I'm not sure how. I'll have to think of something during my shift. I arrive at the bar and unlock the door. I flipping on the lights and get the bar set up for the day. I put on some music and start cleaning glasses. A few hours later, the bar starts to get busy. I'm shaking cocktails and chatting with customers. I see my girlfriend walk in and I know I need to talk to her. I start to head over, but she walks out before I have a chance. I'm relieved and continue working. The rest of my shift goes by without any issues. I close up the bar and go home.
