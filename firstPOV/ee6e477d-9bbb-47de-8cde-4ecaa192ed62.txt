I'm walking along the beach, admiring the view as the sun sets over the horizon. The sky is a beautiful orange hue, and the waves are crashing against the shore. The smell of salt water is in the air, and I'm holding a pink umbrella in one hand and a book in the other. As I walk, I look down and see a stranger walking towards me. He's a tall, handsome man, and he's wearing a blue button-down shirt and khaki shorts. He has a backpack slung over one shoulder, and he's carrying a camera in his hand. He smiles at me, and I smile back. We start talking, and soon discover that we have a lot in common. We walk along the beach together, talking and laughing. The sun sets, and the stars come out. I ask the stranger if he wants to sit down and watch the waves, and he agrees. We sit down on the sand and talk for a while longer. Then he says that he has to go, but he thanks me for the conversation. He says that he hopes to see me again, and I watch him walk away. I look up at the stars and smile.
