I'm weaving my way through the crowd, trying to make my delivery. The sun is just starting to come up, and the concertgoers are milling about, chatting and laughing. There's a palpable excitement in the air - everyone knows that the headlining act is about to take the stage soon. I finally spot my target near the front of the stage and make my way over. The recipient, a young woman, thanks me with a smile. She's got a good spot near the front, and she's obviously excited for the show. I turn to leave, but not before I'm caught up in the excitement myself. I can't help but stop and watch as the first band takes the stage and starts to play. It's going to be a good day.
