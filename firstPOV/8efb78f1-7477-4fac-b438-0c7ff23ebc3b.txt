I woke up early this morning, as I always do during the week. I yawned and stretched, then got out of bed and headed for the bathroom. I relieved myself, then splashed some cold water on my face to wake myself up fully. I dried off my face and hands with a towel, then went back into my bedroom and got dressed for the day. I put on a pair of comfortable jeans and a T-shirt, then slipped into my shoes and headed downstairs. I own a small coffee shop, which I open every morning at 6:00. I unlock the front door and step inside, flipping on the lights as I go. I head behind the counter and start getting everything ready for the day. I brew a pot of coffee and set out some pastries and muffins, then begin working on the day's specials. I always enjoy getting the shop ready for the day, and I love chatting with my regular customers when they come in. Before long, it's 6:00 and I open the doors to my shop. The first few customers come in and I greet them warmly, getting them their usual drinks and chatting with them for a few minutes. The morning rush starts and I am kept busy for the next few hours, making coffee and serving customers. I take a quick break mid-morning to eat a muffin and drink a cup of coffee myself, then it's back to work. The morning rushes by and soon it's time for me to start getting things ready for lunch. I put out some soup and sandwiches, then start prepping some salads. I know my lunch crowd will be in soon, and I want to be ready for them. Before long, the lunch rush is in full swing and I am once again busy serving customers. I chat with them as they eat, getting to know them and making them feel welcome. After the lunch rush dies down, I clean up the shop and get things ready for the afternoon. I take a quick break to eat my own lunch, then it's back to work. The afternoon is relatively quiet, with only a few customers trickling in. I take the opportunity to do some cleaning and restocking, and I also work on preparing for the next day. I know the morning rush will be here before I know it, and I want to be ready for it. Before long, it's time to start getting things ready for the evening rush. I put out some cookies and other snacks, then start making coffee. I know my evening customers will be in soon, and I want to have everything ready for them. The evening rush starts and I am once again busy serving customers. I chat with them as they come in, getting to know them and making them feel welcome. After the rush dies down, I clean up the shop and get things ready for the next day. I know the morning rush will be here before I know it, and I want to be ready for it.
