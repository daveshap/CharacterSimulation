I always enjoy watching the sun set over the ocean. There's something about the way the light dances on the waves that's always calming to me. Tonight, I'm watching the sunset from a quiet beach in Asia. I've been working on a construction project in the area for the past few months, and I'm finally able to take a few days off. As I watch the sun dip below the horizon, I feel a sense of peace wash over me. It's nice to just sit and relax, without having to worry about work or anything else. I'm so lost in thought that I don't hear someone approach from behind. "Excuse me, sir?" I turn to see a young woman standing there. She's holding a small bag in one hand and a camera in the other. "Do you mind if I take a picture of you?" she asks. I'm a bit surprised, but I don't mind. I pose for a few pictures as the woman snaps away. "Thank you so much!" she says when she's finished. "Have a nice evening." I watch her walk away before turning back to the ocean. The sun is almost completely gone now, but the waves are still glimmering in the waning light. I take a deep breath and feel my worries start to melt away. It's going to be a good night.
