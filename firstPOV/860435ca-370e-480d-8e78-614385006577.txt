The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon as I stepped out of the door, a basket under my arm. I stopped for a moment to take in the peacefulness of the morning, and then started down the path towards the village. I had to be at the store early today, and I didn't want to be late. The walk into the village was pleasant, and I breathed in the fresh air deeply, enjoying the peace and quiet. The village was still asleep when I arrived at the store, but I knew that wouldn't last long. I unlocked the door and stepped inside, flipping on the lights. I started unpacking the basket of produce I had brought with me, and then I heard the door open. I turned to see who it was, and my heart sank when I saw who it was. It was Vlad, the village bully. Vlad was a large man, and he always liked to intimidate people. I was sure that Vlad was going to make my life difficult today.
