I enter the bedroom and immediately notice the fallen picture frame on the floor. I know my wife won't be happy about this, so I quickly try to clean up the mess before she gets home. I pick up the frame and set it back on the nightstand, but the glass is shattered and the photo is ruined. I look around for something to cover the frame with, but can't find anything. I end up using a shirt from the laundry basket to drape over the frame. I know it's not a perfect solution, but it will have to do until I can buy a new frame. I hear my wife's car pull up in the driveway and hurriedly finish cleaning up the bedroom. I know she's going to be tired from work and doesn't want to add to her stress. As she enters the bedroom, I can tell she's not happy. She looks around the room and sees the shirt-covered frame on the nightstand. She knows I was trying to help, but she can't hide her disappointment. I try to apologize, but my wife is already exhausted from her day and doesn't want to deal with this right now. She tells me to just leave it and goes to take a shower. I know I've messed up, but I'm grateful that my wife is at least willing to let me try to make things right. I'm determined to find a new frame for the picture as soon as possible.
