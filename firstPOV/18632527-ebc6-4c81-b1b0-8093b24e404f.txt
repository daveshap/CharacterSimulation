I'm out delivering packages in Africa, and I've got a truck full of goods to deliver. I have to be careful, though. There are lions and other dangerous animals roaming around, and I don't want to end up as their breakfast. I drive slowly and carefully, keeping an eye out for any signs of danger. I'm getting close to my final destination, when I see something moving in the bushes. I slow down, heart pounding, and try to see what it is. It's a lion! My truck is between the lion and its prey, and the lion is not happy about it. I know I need to get out of there quickly, before the lion decides to attack. I reverse the truck and drive away as fast as I can. I'm shaken, but I'm safe. I've learned my lesson - I'll be more careful in the future.
