I had been walking for hours, ever since I had become separated from my group during the night. I wasn't even sure where I was anymore, except that I knew I was somewhere in the dark forest in South America. My only hope was to find my way out before nightfall. As I continued to walk, I heard a branch snap nearby. I froze, straining to see through the darkness. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the trees and I let out a scream before I was silenced by a strong hand over my mouth.
