I was just finishing up my shift when I noticed the open window and blowing curtains. I also saw that the bed was unmade and there were clothes strewn about the room. I was about to close the window when I heard a noise coming from the other side of the room. I froze, not knowing what to do. Suddenly, a woman came into the room. She was wearing a robe and her hair was wet, like she'd just gotten out of the shower. She saw me and started to scream. I quickly closed the window and tried to calm her down. I explained that I was just a delivery driver and that I didn't mean to scare her. Eventually, she calmed down and I was able to leave the room. As I was walking down the hall, I could hear her screams echo in my mind.
