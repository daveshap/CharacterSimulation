I'm busy at work, hammering away at some bolts on the underside of the Eiffel Tower. I've been working on this section for a few hours now, and I'm starting to get hungry. I take a quick break to eat my lunch, sitting on a girder with my feet dangling over the edge. I look out at the view of Paris spread out below me and take a deep breath of the fresh air. What a day to be working on the Eiffel Tower!
