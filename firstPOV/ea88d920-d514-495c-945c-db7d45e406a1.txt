I'm walking through the jungle, trying to find my way back to camp. I'm sweating and panting, and my heart is pounding in my chest. I can hear the sounds of animals all around me, and I'm getting scared. Suddenly, I hear a loud roar and see a lion in front of me. I start to run, but the lion is faster and catches up to me. I feel the lion's teeth sink into my flesh and I scream in pain. I know I'm going to die.
