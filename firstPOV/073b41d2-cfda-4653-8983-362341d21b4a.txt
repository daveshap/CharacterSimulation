The moon is a barren, lifeless place. The only sound is the faint hiss of my oxygen tank as I move slowly across the dusty surface. I am wearing a bulky spacesuit and carrying a large backpack filled with supplies. It is the middle of the night, but the sunlight is still bright enough to see by. I am moving cautiously, my eyes darting around for any signs of danger. I know that there are many hazards on the moon, and I do not want to take any chances. Suddenly, I hear a noise behind me. I freeze, my heart pounding in my chest. I slowly turn around, but there is nothing there. I exhale a sigh of relief and continue on my way. After a few more minutes, I reach my destination: a small crater that is my home. I climb down into the crater and set my backpack down. I am tired from my journey, but I am happy to be home. I take off my helmet and begin to unpack my supplies, preparing for another long night on the moon.
