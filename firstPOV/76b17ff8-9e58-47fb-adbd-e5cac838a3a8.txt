The early morning sun casts a pale glow over the barren landscape of the moon as I take my regular morning walk. I enjoy the tranquility of the morning, until I suddenly hear a loud noise behind me. I turn around to see a large object hurtling towards me at high speed. I have just enough time to register the fear on my face before the object hits me, sending me flying through the air. I crash to the ground, unconscious. I am bleeding heavily from a head wound. The impact has caused my helmet to crack, and my oxygen supply is leaking out. If I don't get help soon, I will die.
