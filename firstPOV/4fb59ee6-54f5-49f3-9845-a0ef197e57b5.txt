I'm a bartender who works the night shift at a local bar. I've just gotten off work and I'm now heading home for the night. It's the middle of the night, so the streets are mostly empty. I'm walking quickly, trying to get home before the sun comes up. Suddenly, I hear a noise coming from a nearby alley. I freeze, unsure of what to do. After a few moments of indecision, I decide to investigate. I cautiously enter the alley, and I'm immediately attacked by a crazed homeless man. The man starts swinging wildly, and I do my best to defend myself. After a few moments, I'm able to subdue the man and tie him up. I'm relieved that the ordeal is over, but I'm now worried that the man might have been sick. I decide to call 911 and wait for the police to arrive.
