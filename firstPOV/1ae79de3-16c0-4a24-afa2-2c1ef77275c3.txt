The sun was setting behind me, and the cool breeze was blowing through my hair. I sat on the edge of the quiet beach, watching the waves crash against the shore. The sky was a beautiful orange, and the stars were shining. I sighed and stood up, brushing the sand off my legs. I was about to go back to my hotel when I saw something in the water. It was a turtle! I smiled and walked over to it, picking it up and putting it back in the sea.
