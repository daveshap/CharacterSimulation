The sun is barely visible through the thick trees, casting a dappled light on the forest floor. I'm picking my way carefully through the undergrowth, my eyes darting around for any signs of danger. I'm on edge, aware that this is not a safe place for a woman alone. Suddenly, I hear a rustling in the bushes ahead of me and my heart sinks. I know I'm not alone in this place anymore. Tentatively, I take a few steps forward, peering into the darkness. And then I see it. A huge, furry creature is standing in front of me, its yellow eyes boring into my soul. I know I'm in danger now. Slowly, I back away, my heart pounding in my chest. The creature follows me, stalking me like prey. I know I'm not going to make it out of this alive.
