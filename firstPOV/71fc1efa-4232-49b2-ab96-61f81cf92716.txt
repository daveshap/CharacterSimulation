I was working the night shift at the grocery store when I heard a strange noise coming from the back of the store. I tried to ignore it, but it was getting louder and more persistent, so I decided to investigate. As I walked towards the back of the store, the noise got louder and more distinct. It sounded like someone was trying to break into the store. I quickly grabbed a baseball bat from under the counter and headed towards the noise. I rounded a corner and came face to face with a man who was trying to break into the store. The man saw me and started to run away. I gave chase, but the man was faster and got away. I was frustrated and angry. I knew the man was probably going to try to break into the store again. I decided to call the police and report the incident.
