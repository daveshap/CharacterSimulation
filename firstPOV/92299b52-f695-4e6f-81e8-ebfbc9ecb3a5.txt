I was driving for hours, and was finally nearing the end of my shift. I was looking forward to getting home and getting some rest. As I pulled up to the address I'd been given, I frowned. It was clearly a residential area, and it was late at night. I was about to turn around and head back to the depot when I noticed a light on in one of the houses. I realized that this must be the right place after all. I pulled up to the house and got out of my car. I could see the light coming from a window on the second floor. I approached the house and knocked on the door. After a moment, a woman answered the door. She looked tired and worried. "I have a delivery for you," I said. The woman took the package from me. "Thank you," she said. "I'm sorry for the trouble." I shrugged. "It's no trouble. I'm just glad I could help." The woman thanked me again and then closed the door. I got back into my car and drove away.
