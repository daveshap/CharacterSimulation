I'm standing on the surface of the moon, next to a small grocery store. It's 6pm, and the store is about to close. I'm wearing a spacesuit and carrying a backpack full of groceries. I walk into the store and am greeted by the clerk, who is also wearing a spacesuit. I begin to browse the shelves, looking for something to eat. I eventually settle on a package of crackers and a bottle of water. I take my groceries to the counter and pay for them. The clerk hands me my change and I give her a friendly smile. I thank her for her help and then head back out into the lunar night.
