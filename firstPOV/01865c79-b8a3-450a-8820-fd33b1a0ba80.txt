I walk through the park, admiring the view of the Eiffel Tower. I've never been to Paris before and I'm in awe of the city around me. I notice a guy sitting on a bench, and I can't help but stare at him. He's tall, with dark hair and piercing blue eyes. I feel a sudden urge to talk to him, and I nervously approach the bench. "Hi, um, do you speak English?" I ask, blushing slightly. He grins and nods, and we start talking. We discover that we have a lot in common, and we end up sitting on the bench for hours, talking and laughing. As the sun sets, he takes my hand and we walk to the top of the Eiffel Tower, where we watch the city lights come alive. I know that I'm going to remember this night for the rest of my life.
