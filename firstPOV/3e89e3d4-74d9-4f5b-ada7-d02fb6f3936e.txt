I was grateful to have found a job so quickly after moving to the city. Sure, it wasn't my dream job, but it paid the bills and that was all that mattered. I arrived at my first day of work, an office building in the financial district, and was surprised to find that my boss was a young woman, barely out of her 20s. I spent the morning getting oriented to my new surroundings and learning the ropes from my boss. I had just sat down at my desk to start working on my first project when I heard a loud crash from the other side of the office. I got up to investigate and found that one of the office workers had accidentally knocked over a stack of papers. I helped the woman clean up the mess and then returned to my desk. I was just getting back to work when I heard another crash, followed by a voice raised in anger. I got up again to see what was going on and found that two of my co-workers were arguing. I tried to diffused the situation and finally convinced the two women to go their separate ways. As I returned to my desk for the third time, I was beginning to feel like this was going to be a long day at the office.
