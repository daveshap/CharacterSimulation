The sun is high in the sky, beating down on the sand and making everything seem hazy. The waves are crashing against the shore, and a light breeze is blowing through the palms. I'm sitting on the beach, eating my lunch and enjoying the view. I've been working on a construction project nearby, and I'm taking a well-deserved break. I've got my feet in the water, and I'm watching the people as they walk by. I'm thinking about how lucky I am to be able to work in such a beautiful place.
