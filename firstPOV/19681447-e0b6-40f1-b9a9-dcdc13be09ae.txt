I was just about to drift off to sleep when I heard a noise outside. I got up to investigate and saw a figure moving around in the shadows near the bushes. I watched as the figure came closer to the house and then suddenly disappeared around the side. I was about to go back to bed when I heard the sound of glass breaking. I knew someone was trying to break into the house! I grabbed a flashlight and headed outside to confront the intruder.
