The forest is drenched in darkness, and I'm picking my way through the undergrowth carefully. My heart is pounding in my chest because I know I'm being followed, and I'm terrified of what might happen if I'm caught. I can hear the leaves rustling behind me as my pursuer gets closer and closer. I'm desperate to find a way out of the forest, but I can't see more than a few feet in front of me. I start running, blind panic driving me forward. Suddenly, I stumble and fall, landing hard on the ground. I feel a sharp pain in my leg, and I know I can't go any further. I try to crawl away, but my pursuer is upon me. I feel a cold hand grip my shoulder, and I know I'm going to die.
