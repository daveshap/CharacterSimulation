I had been hiking for hours when I finally reached the top of the mountain. The view was breathtaking, and I could see the sun beginning to set. As I reached the summit, I saw a small cabin perched on the edge of a cliff. It looked abandoned, but I decided to check it out anyway. The door was unlocked, and I stepped inside. It was musty and dusty, but it appeared to be unused. I explored the small cabin, and eventually made my way to the bedroom. There was a small bed in the corner, and a window overlooking the valley below. I sat down on the bed and watched the sun set. It was a beautiful sight, and I felt at peace.
