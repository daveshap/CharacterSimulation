I was standing on a mountaintop in Europe, watching the sun set. I was wearing a light jacket to keep myself warm, and I was clutching a small bouquet of flowers. I was smiling and looked very happy. Suddenly, I heard a noise behind me. I turned around to see a large, hairy creature standing a few feet away from me. The creature was taller than me and had a long snout. It was staring at me with its small, beady eyes. I screamed and ran away from the creature. I was running as fast as I could, but the creature was quickly catching up to me. I tripped on a rock and fell to the ground. The creature was now standing over me, drooling. I closed my eyes and prepared for the worst. But then, I heard someone yelling. I opened my eyes to see a man running towards the creature, waving a large stick. The man hit the creature over the head with the stick, and it ran away. The man helped me to my feet and asked if I was okay. I nodded, still in shock. I thanked the man for saving me and then ran back down the mountain, vowing never to return.
