I was sitting on a bench near my truck, enjoying a meal of rice and beans, when I suddenly heard a loud noise. I looked up and saw a herd of elephants stampeding towards me. I knew I wouldn't be able to outrun them, so I quickly jumped into my truck and tried to start it. The engine roared to life and I hit the gas, speeding away from the dangerous animals. I breathed a sigh of relief as I put some distance between myself and the elephants. That was a close one!
