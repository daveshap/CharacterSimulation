I'm Mashawn, a construction worker. I'm working on the Eiffel Tower, drilling holes into the scaffolding. It's hot, and I'm sweating. My muscles are straining, and I'm focused on my work. Suddenly, I hear a loud noise. I look up and see that a scaffolding pole has snapped and is falling towards me. I try to move out of the way, but it hits me and knocks me off the scaffolding. I scream as I fall. I hit the ground hard and am knocked unconscious.
