I'm resting on a mountaintop in Europe, surrounded by the beautiful scenery. It's a peaceful and calming scene, and I'm enjoying the tranquility. Suddenly, I hear a noise in the distance and see a large group of people coming up the mountain. I know they're headed for the bar I work at, and I know that they're going to be thirsty. I quickly get up and head down the mountain to get the bar ready for the customers.
