I finish my last cigarette of the day, looking out at the quiet beach. I've been working hard all day, and I'm ready to relax. The sun is setting, and the sky is a beautiful orange. The waves are crashing against the shore, and the smell of salt is in the air. I breathe in deeply, and feel the stress of the day melting away. I'm looking forward to a cold beer and a good night's sleep.
