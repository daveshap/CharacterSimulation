I was standing on a mountaintop in Europe, surrounded by jagged peaks and dense forests. The sun was setting, painting the sky in shades of orange and red. I was admiring the view, feeling thankful for the peace and quiet of this remote location. Suddenly, I heard a loud noise coming from the direction of the nearest peak. I looked up just in time to see a large boulder tumbling down the mountainside, headed straight for me. I tried to run, but the boulder was too fast. It slammed into me, crushing me instantly. As my life faded away, I heard the sound of laughter coming from the peak.
