I line up my tools on the floor, making sure they're all within reach. I've been working hard all day and am ready to relax. I kick off my shoes and flopp down on the bed, letting out a deep sigh. I stare up at the ceiling, letting my mind wander. I think about my day and the progress I've made on the construction site. I'm proud of my work, but it's tough going. I'm glad I have a place to rest my head at night. Suddenly, I hear a noise outside. I sit up, alert and listening. The noise gets louder and I realize someone is trying to break into my house. I leap up from the bed and cross to the door, heart pounding. I grab my hammer and stand to the side of the door, waiting for the intruder. The intruder kicks the door open and I swing my hammer, hitting them in the head. They fall to the ground, unconscious. I breathe a sigh of relief and drop my hammer. I didn't want to hurt anyone, but I'm glad I was able to defend myself.
