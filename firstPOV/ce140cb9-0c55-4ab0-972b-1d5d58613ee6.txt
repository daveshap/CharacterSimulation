I'm sitting on the beach, enjoying the quiet and peacefulness of the moment. I've been wanting to get away from the hustle and bustle of my everyday life and just relax for a while. It's been a few months since I've been on a vacation and I'm really enjoying this time to myself. I've got a little picnic set up next to me, with a few snacks and drinks to keep me going. I've got my book with me, but I'm not really in the mood to read it. I'm just enjoying the sound of the waves and the feel of the sand between my toes. Every now and then, I look up at the people walking by, but for the most part, I'm content to just sit here and enjoy the moment.
