I was lying on my bed, trying to block out the light with my arm across my eyes. I could hear Sarah coming up the stairs, and I knew she was coming to my room. I sat up and she came in, holding a suitcase and a box. She looked determined. "I'm leaving," she said. "I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry." I looked at her for a moment, then nodded. I didn't say anything. Sarah turned and picked up her things again. She started to walk out of the room, but paused and looked back at me. "I loved you," she said. "I really did." Then she was gone, and I was alone.
