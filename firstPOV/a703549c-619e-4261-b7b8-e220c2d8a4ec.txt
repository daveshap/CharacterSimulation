I'm sitting at my desk in the office, munching on a sandwich and scrolling through my phone. I'm wearing my school uniform, and my backpack is sitting next to my chair. I'm surrounded by stacks of papers and folders, and the phone is the only thing that's really keeping my attention. Every so often, I glance up at the clock, and then go back to my phone.
