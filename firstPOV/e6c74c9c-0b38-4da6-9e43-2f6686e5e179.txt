The forest is eerily quiet as I make my way through the dense foliage. I've been working on the construction site for weeks now and I'm starting to get homesick. My mind wanders as I think about my family back home and how much I miss them. Suddenly, I hear a branch snap behind me. Whirling around, I draw my knife from my pocket, my heart pounding in my chest. Peering into the darkness, I can't see anything. I start to relax, thinking it was just my imagination, when a huge jaguar leaps out of the shadows and charges towards me. I barely have time to react before the jaguar is upon me, knocking me to the ground. I feel the sharp teeth sink into my flesh as I scream for help. The jaguar shakes me like a rag doll, before finally losing interest and wandering off into the jungle, leaving me bleeding and whimpering in pain.
