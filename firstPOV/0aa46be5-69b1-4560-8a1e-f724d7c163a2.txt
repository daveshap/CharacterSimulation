I can't believe I'm actually in Africa. I've been wanting to take a trip like this for years, and I'm finally here. The sun is setting over the savannah, and I'm watching the animals graze on the grass. I'm entranced by the scene before me and the peace I feel. I know this is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I don't want to miss a thing. The next morning, I wake early and go for a walk. I see impalas, gazelles, and even a lioness stalking her prey. I'm careful to stay out of the way and not disturb the animals. This is an amazing experience, and I'm so glad I'm here to enjoy it.
