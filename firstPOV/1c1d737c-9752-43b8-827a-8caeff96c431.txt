I was just sitting in my bedroom, relaxing after a long day at work. I was in an old, comfortable chair, with a cup of coffee in hand. The room was fairly simple, with a bed, a dresser, and a few other pieces of furniture. There were no decorations on the walls or anything else that would personalize the space. It was clear that I didn't spend a lot of time in here. I took a sip of my coffee and let out a sigh. It had been a long day and I was ready to relax. I was just about to take another sip when I heard a knock at the door. I got up to answer it and found my neighbor, Mrs. Anderson, standing there. "Hello, Bob," she said. "I was just wondering if you could help me with something." I set my coffee down and invited Mrs. Anderson into the house. She explained that her son was in the hospital and she was having a hard time getting ahold of her husband. She asked if I could watch her daughter for a few hours. I agreed to help, and Mrs. Anderson handed me a key. She thanked me and hurried off. I closed the door and headed back to my bedroom, where I finished my coffee and contemplated my evening.
