I woke up early on a bright, sunny morning. I felt well-rested and energized, ready to start my day. I got out of bed and walked to my window, looking out at the city. The streets were busy with people walking and cars driving. I saw the skyline in the distance and the tall buildings reaching up into the sky. I took a deep breath and felt thankful to be alive and living in such a beautiful city.
