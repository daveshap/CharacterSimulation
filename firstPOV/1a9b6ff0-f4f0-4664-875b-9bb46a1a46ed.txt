The sky is a deep black, filled with stars. The moon is a bright, whitedisk, hanging low in the sky. I am standing on the lunar surface,wearing a spacesuit. I am holding a laptop computer in one hand,and a cord in the other. The cord is attached to a satellite dish. I am a software engineer. I work for a company that Develops software for the International Space Station. I am also an amateur astronomer, and I am passionate about space exploration. This morning, I am going to try to communicate with the International Space Station using my laptop and the satellite dish. I have never tried this before, and I am not sure if it will work. But I am hopeful that I will be able to establish a connection. I turn on my laptop and start to type. I enter a command that should direct the satellite dish to the International Space Station. Then I wait. After a few minutes, I begin to lose hope. It doesn't seem like my laptop is doing anything. But then, all of a sudden, I see a message on my screen. "Hello, Swathi. This is the International Space Station. We can hear you loud and clear." I can't believe it. I have made contact with the International Space Station. I am ecstatic. I continue to talk to the astronauts on the space station, asking them about their work and their life in space. I am having the time of my life. I know that this is a moment that I will never forget.
