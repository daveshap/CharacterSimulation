I'm Tom, a bartender at a small bar in Africa. It's 6pm and the bar is starting to fill up with people looking for a place to drink and relax after a long day. I'm busy making drinks and chatting with the customers. I know most of them by name and they all seem to like me. Suddenly, the door bursts open and a group of men come into the bar. They're armed with guns and knives and they're all wearing masks. I freeze. The men start shouting and demanding money from the customers. They threaten to kill anyone who doesn't comply. I'm terrified. I have no idea what to do. The men start picking people up and shaking them down for their valuables. They take the money from the till and start to head towards the door. As they're leaving, one of the men grabs me and puts a gun to my head. He tells me to empty the till. I do as I'm told and the man gives me a stack of cash. The men then leave the bar, leaving me and the other customers behind. I'm shaking and I can't believe what just happened. This is the worst day of my life.
