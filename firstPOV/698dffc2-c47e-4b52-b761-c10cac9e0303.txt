I was just finishing up my workday when I heard a noise. It sounded like something was falling. I looked up and saw a man falling from the upper floors of the building! I rushed over to try and catch the man, but I was too late. He landed with a thud on the ground, right at my feet. He was clearly dead. I was horrified. I didn't know what to do. I looked around, but there was no one else around. I was alone with the body. After a few moments, I decided to go and find someone to get help. I left the body where it is and went to find someone.
