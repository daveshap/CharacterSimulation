I was just about to finish up when I heard a noise outside my office. I got up to investigate and saw a man in a ski mask trying to break into the office next door. I grabbed a baseball bat and confronted the man. The man tried to run away, but I caught up to him and knocked him out with the bat. I called the police and told them what happened. They arrested the man and took him away. I went back to my office and finished up my work.
