I walk down the busy sidewalk, my backpack straps cutting into my shoulders. The sun is beating down on me, and I can feel the sweat trickling down my back. I'm on my way to meet my friends for lunch, and I can't wait to get out of the heat. As I approach the restaurant, I see my friends sitting at a table near the window. They wave me over, and I eagerly make my way inside. I slide into the seat next to my best friend, Katie, and let out a sigh of relief. "It's so hot out there," I say, fanning myself with my hand. "I know," Katie responds. "I can't wait for summer to be over." I nod in agreement as I open the menu. I know I won't be able to eat much in this heat, but I'm determined to at least try.
