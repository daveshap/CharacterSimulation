I'm Wang, and I'm driving my delivery truck across the craggy surface of the moon. The early morning sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a long shadow behind the truck. I'm making my final delivery of the day, a load of construction supplies bound for a lunar base on the far side of the moon. I'm tired from the long night of driving, but I know that I only have a few more minutes to go. I crest a small hill and see the base in the distance. I press down on the accelerator and the truck lurches forward. I arrive at the base and pull up to the loading dock. I hop out of the truck and begin unloading the supplies. I work quickly, knowing that I want to get back to my truck and head home before the sun gets too high in the sky. Within a few minutes, I have finished unloading the supplies and am back in my truck, heading home. I drive across the lunar landscape, the only sound the hum of the truck's engine. I look up at the sky and see the Earth, a bright blue-and-white ball hanging in the blackness. I think about my family back home and how I can't wait to see them again. I know that it will be a long time before I'm able to return to Earth, but I'm happy to be able to work and live on the moon.
