I was just finishing up at the office building for the day, when I heard a noise coming from the back room. I froze, listening carefully. There it is again! Someone is definitely in the back room! I slowly grab a baseball bat from under the counter and start to creep towards the back room. My heart is pounding in my chest as I wonder what I'm going to find. As I get closer, I hear the noise again. It sounds like someone is rummaging through the storage room. I take a deep breath and burst into the room, swinging the bat. "Who's there?!" I shout. To my surprise, I find a small child, no more than 10 years old, standing in the middle of the room. The child is holding a bag of chips and looks up at me with wide eyes. "I'm sorry!" the child says, dropping the bag of chips. "I was just hungry." I lower the bat, my heart still racing. I can't believe what I've just found. A small child, all alone in the office building, rummaging through the storage room for food. I look at the child, feeling a sudden surge of compassion. I can't just leave this child here alone. I have to help. "It's okay," I say, taking a step closer. "I'm not going to hurt you. Come with me, and I'll get you something to eat." The child nods, and I take them by the hand, leading them out of the office building. I know I'm going to have to find a way to help this child, but I don't know where to start.
