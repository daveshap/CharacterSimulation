I sit in my hut surrounded by my five children. It's been a long day and I'm exhausted, but I know I have to stay up a little longer to make sure my little ones are all fed and tucked in for the night. I start a small fire in the center of the hut and begin to cook the evening meal. My children watch eagerly as the pot of stew begins to simmer. I ladle out bowls of steaming stew for my children and we all sit down to eat. As we eat, I tell my children stories about my own childhood in Africa. I talk about the animals I used to see and the adventures I used to have. My children listen raptly, their eyes wide with wonder. Eventually, I tuck my children into bed, one by one. I kiss each of them goodnight, and tell them I love them. I then sit down by the fire to enjoy a few moments of peace before I, too, go to bed. I gaze into the flames, lost in thought, until I finally fall asleep.
