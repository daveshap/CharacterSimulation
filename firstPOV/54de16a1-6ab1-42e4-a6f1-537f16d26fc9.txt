I was just about to lock up the store for the night when I heard a loud noise outside. It sounded like someone was running towards the store. I unlocked the door and saw a man running towards me, followed by a pack of lions. The man was terrified and I knew he wouldn't be able to outrun the lions. I was about to close the door and lock the man out when I saw the fear in his eyes. I couldn't just leave him to die. I yelled for the man to come inside and ran to the back of the store to get a can of pepper spray. I wasn't sure if it would work on lions, but it was all I had. I sprayed the lions as they came through the door and they started to back away. The man was safe, at least for now. I knew the lions would be back, so I locked the doors and prepared to defend the store all night.
