I arrived home from school, relieved to be finished with my studies for the day. I entered my cottage and headed straight for the kitchen, where I began preparing my dinner. I hummed softly to myself as I worked, content in the peace and quiet of my home. Suddenly, there was a loud crash from outside. I jumped, startled by the noise. I hurriedly went to the window to see what was happening. Outside, I saw a large buck had crashed into my garden, uprooting my flowers and trampling my vegetables. The buck looked dazed and confused, and I knew it wouldn't be long before it caused more damage. I quickly grabbed my shotgun and ran outside, yelling at the buck to try and scare it away. The buck only looked at me, seeming almost defiant, before turning and running off into the woods. I was relieved that the buck was gone but was sadly left with the mess it had made of my garden. I knew it would take weeks of hard work to repair the damage, but I was determined to get my garden back to its former glory.
