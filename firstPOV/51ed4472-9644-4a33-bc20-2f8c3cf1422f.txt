I sit on the porch and watch the children play in the yard as the sun sets behind the trees. They're laughing and chasing each other around and I can't help but smile. It's been a long day, but I don't mind. I love spending time with the kids. They always make me laugh and I enjoy seeing them happy. Eventually, the children start to get tired and they come to sit with me on the porch. We chat for a while about their day, and then it's time for bed. I tuck them in and give them each a goodnight kiss. I linger in the hallway for a moment, listening to their soft breathing as they drift off to sleep. Then I quietly close the door and head back to the porch. I sit down and look up at the stars, taking a moment to relax before heading home.
