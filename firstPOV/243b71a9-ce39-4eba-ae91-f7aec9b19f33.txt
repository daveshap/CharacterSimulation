I walked under the Eiffel Tower, admiring its grandeur in the moonlight. I had always wanted to visit Paris, and now that I was here, I was determined to make the most of it. I had only been in the city for a few days, but I had already fallen in love with it. as I walked, I felt a sense of unease. I told myself it was just because I was in a foreign city, but I couldn't shake the feeling. I quickened my pace, but before I could reach my hotel, I was grabbed from behind. I struggled to free myself, but the man was too strong. He covered my mouth with his hand to keep me from screaming, and dragged me into an alleyway. My heart was pounding in my chest as I realized I was going to be raped. The man pushed me to the ground and pulled my dress up. I fought back, but it was futile. The man was too strong and too drunk. I felt his hands on my body, exploring me, and then I felt the pain as he forced himself inside me. I cried out, but it only made him more excited. He kept forcing himself deeper and deeper until I thought I would die from the pain. I begged and pleaded for him to stop, but he only laughed and kept going. Eventually, he finish and rolled off of me. I lay there, crying and shaking, my dress still around my waist. I felt dirty and violated, and I knew I would never be the same again.
