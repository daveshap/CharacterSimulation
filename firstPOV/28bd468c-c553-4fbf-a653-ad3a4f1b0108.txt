The fog is so thick that I can barely see a few feet in front of me. I've been hiking for hours, and I'm exhausted. I stop to take a break, and lean against a large rock to catch my breath. Suddenly, I hear a noise in the distance. It sounds like someone is calling my name. I can't see anyone, but I start to walk towards the sound. The fog gets thicker and thicker, until I can't see my hand in front of my face. I'm disoriented and lost. The noise gets louder and I start to run. I stumble and fall, hitting my head on a rock. I'm knocked unconscious.
