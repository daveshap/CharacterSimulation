I was sitting in the middle of the concert hall, surrounded by people chatting and laughing. I looked a little out of place, like I wasn't quite sure why I was there. I was holding a cup of coffee and looking around nervously. Suddenly, the lights dimmed and the concert began. I was startled by the sudden change in atmosphere and looked around, wide-eyed. I watched the performers on stage for a moment, before starting to feel restless. I took a sip of my coffee and looked around again, before getting up and leaving the concert hall.
