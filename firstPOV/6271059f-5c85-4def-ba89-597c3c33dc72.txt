I'm nervously walking through a dark forest in South America, looking for the house I'm supposed to be babysitting at. It's 6pm and I'm already an hour late. I'm carrying a flashlight and a bag of babysitting supplies. I'm wearing a brightly colored shirt and pants so I'll be easier to see in the darkness. I'm also wearing a pair of sneakers in case I need to run away from anything. I hear a branch snap and stop in my tracks, shining my flashlight in the direction of the noise. I see a large, furry creature standing in the shadows, watching me. I gasp and back away slowly, never taking my eyes off of the creature. The creature starts to come towards me and I turn and run in the opposite direction. I can hear the creature following me, but I don't look back. I run until I reach the house I'm supposed to be babysitting at and go inside, locking the door behind me. I'm safe for now, but I'm sure the creature is still out there, lurking in the darkness.
