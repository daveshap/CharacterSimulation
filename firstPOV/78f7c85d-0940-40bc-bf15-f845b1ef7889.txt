I'm getting really scared. I've been walking for hours, and I can't find my way back to the house where I was babysitting. I've tried calling my parents, but there's no service. I've tried to find my way back to the house, but I'm completely lost. Suddenly, I hear something in the bushes. I'm terrified, and I don't know what to do. I stand there, frozen, as the thing in the bushes comes closer and closer. I can see it now... it's a big, dark, furry creature. It's a bear! The bear is coming towards me, and I'm too scared to move. I'm sure I'm going to be killed, but then the bear just walks right past me. I'm so relieved, I almost fall over. I know I have to keep moving, but I'm so tired and scared. I don't know how much longer I can go on. I'm about to give up when I see a light in the distance. I start walking towards it, and I soon see that it's a campfire. There are people around the campfire, and they see me coming. They call out to me, and I'm so relieved. I've finally found my way out of the forest.
