The air is crisp and cold on the mountaintop, with a strong wind blowing. I'm wearing a heavy coat and gloves as I work, shoveling snow off the ground. I pause occasionally to catch my breath, and look around at the breathtaking view. In the distance, I can see the town I live in, and the valleys and hills beyond. I've been working on this construction project for several weeks now, and I'm getting close to finishing. I've been excited to see the finished product, and can't wait to show it off to my friends and family. Suddenly, I hear a loud noise behind me. I turn around to see a large boulder rolling down the hill towards me. I have just enough time to jump out of the way before it hits me. I'm shaken up but uninjured. I look at the boulder and see that it has smashed the section of the wall I was working on. I sigh and start to shovel the snow back into place. It's going to be a long day.
