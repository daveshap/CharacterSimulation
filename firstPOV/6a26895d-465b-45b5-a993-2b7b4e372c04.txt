I'm driving my delivery truck through a dark forest in South America. I'm mid-way through my delivery route when I notice something strange up ahead. It looks like there is a large object blocking the road. As I get closer, I realize that it is a fallen tree. There is no way around it. I decide to try to move the tree myself. I get out of the truck and try to push the tree off the road. But it is too heavy. I try to climb the tree to see if I can get a better grip, but I slip and fall to the ground. I hurt my leg in the fall. I'm now stuck in the forest, with no way to move the tree and no way to call for help. I'm going to have to spend the night in the forest.
