I was so close to finishing my project when my boss came in and ruined everything. He thrust a stack of papers into my hands and said, "Swathi, I need you to take a look at this." I had no idea what it was, but I could tell from the look on his face that it wasn't good. "What is it?" I asked. "It's the reports from the beta test of the software you've been working on," he replied. "There are a lot of issues that need to be fixed before we can release it to the public." My heart sank. I knew that this meant I was going to have to go back and make a lot of changes. But I knew that was just part of the job. I took the papers from my boss and got to work.
