I'm standing in the middle of my coffee shop, surrounded by the detritus of the day's business. Chairs are upended on tables, half-empty cups of coffee sit forgotten, and paper wrappers and napkins are strewn everywhere. The only light comes from the neon sign above the door, which casts a garish, red glow over everything. Suddenly, the door swings open and a man staggers in. He's obviously drunk, and he's clutching a bottle of what smells like cheap bourbon. I take a step back, warily eyeing the man. The man weaves his way over to the counter and slumps down onto a stool. He looks up at me with bleary eyes and slurs, "Coffee. Black. Make it strong." I hesitate for a moment, but then I nod and begin to brew a cup of coffee. As I do, I keep a close eye on the man, who seems to be getting more and more agitated. Suddenly, he lashes out, smashing his bottle on the counter and sending glass and liquor everywhere. "That's it!" I yell, reaching for the bat I keep behind the counter. "You're out of here!" The man tries to stand up, but he's too unsteady on his feet. I grab him by the arm and drag him to the door, throwing him out into the night. As the door swings shut, I can hear the man's enraged, drunken shouts fading into the distance.
