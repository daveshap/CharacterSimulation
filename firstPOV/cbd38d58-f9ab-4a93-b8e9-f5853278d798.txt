I step out of my airlock and onto the dusty, gray surface of the moon. I take a deep breath of the sterile air and adjust my suit. I start walking across the lunar landscape, my destination the nearby moon base. As I walk, I take in the desolate beauty of my surroundings. The sun casts a cold light on the jagged mountains and craters. I feel a sense of peace and wonder as I march onward. I soon arrive at the base and am greeted by the other inhabitants. They invite me in for lunch and I eagerly accept. I take off my helmet and enjoy a meal with my new friends, feeling grateful for the moment of companionship in this lonely place.
