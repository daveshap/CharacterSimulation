I make my way up the winding path, stopping for a moment to take in the view. The valley below me is blanketed in a thin layer of mist, and the first rays of sunlight are starting to filter through. I continue on my way, and I hear the sound of birdsong in the distance. I round a corner and come upon a small clearing, where a family of deer are grazing. I stop to watch them for a moment before continuing on my way. I finally reach the top of the mountain, where a small stone hut stands. I go inside and light a fire in the stove, then begin to prepare breakfast. As I work, I look out the window at the breathtaking view of the valley below.
