I'm at a concert in the middle of the night. It's a big concert, and I'm surrounded by people. I'm dancing and singing along to the music, and I'm having a great time. I'm wearing a bright pink dress and my hair is flowing around me. I look like I'm in my element, and I'm completely surrounded by the music.
