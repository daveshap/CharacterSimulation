I'm in the middle of the concert, surrounded by people dancing and singing along to the music. I'm wearing a flowy white dress and my hair is flowing down my back in loose waves. I look like a goddess amidst the chaos and I'm completely in my element. The music is loud and the bass is throbbing, but I don't mind. I'm lost in the moment, dancing with my eyes closed and my arms up in the air. I'm completely absorbed in the music and the energy of the crowd around me. Suddenly, I feel someone bump into me from behind. I open my eyes and turn to see a tall, handsome man standing there. He apologizes and we start talking. I can't believe my luck when I find out that he's also a software engineer. We bond over our shared love of music and dance the night away.
