I'm sitting in the bedroom, watching TV. It's the middle of the night, and I'm bored. I've been babysitting the kids for hours, and they're finally asleep. I'm thinking about going to bed myself, but I'm not tired. Suddenly, I hear a noise from downstairs. It sounds like someone is walking around. I'm scared. I don't know what to do. I don't want to go downstairs and see who it is, but I have to. Slowly, I get up from the bed and creak my way downstairs. I'm terrified, but I have to see who's there. I reach the bottom of the stairs and look into the living room. I see a figure standing there, and I gasp. The figure is a man, and he's holding a knife. He sees me and starts to walk towards me. I'm frozen with fear. I don't know what to do. I'm shaking, and I can feel the cold blade of the knife against my skin. The man begins to lead me upstairs, and I know I'm in trouble. I don't know what he's going to do to me, but I'm sure it won't be good. I'm shaking so badly that I can barely walk, but the man pushes me forward. He leads me into the bedroom where the kids are sleeping. I'm terrified. I don't know what he's going to do to me, but I'm sure it won't be good.
