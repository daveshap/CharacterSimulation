I was making a delivery to a mountaintop in Europe. I drove up to the mountaintop and saw that there was a beautiful view of the countryside. I got out of my truck and started to unload the boxes of goods that I was delivering. Suddenly, I heard a noise behind me. I turned around and saw a large, ferocious looking dog. The dog was growling and coming towards me. I dropped the boxes and ran back to my truck. I got in and drove away as fast as I could.
