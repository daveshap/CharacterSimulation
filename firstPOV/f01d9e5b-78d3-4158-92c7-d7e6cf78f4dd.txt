I'm Bob, a coffee shop owner who lives on the moon. My coffee shop is the only one on the moon, and I've been in business for about a year. I'm doing pretty well, but I'm always looking for ways to improve my business. Tonight, I'm staying open a little later than usual. I'm hoping that some of the night shift workers will come in for a cup of coffee before they head home. Around 6pm, a few of the night shift workers start to trickle into the coffee shop. I greet them all with a smile and offer them their favorite coffee drinks. The night shift workers are happy to have a place to relax and chat before they head home. As the night goes on, more and more night shift workers come into the coffee shop. I keep them all entertained with stories and jokes. I know most of them by name, and they all seem to enjoy my company. By the end of the night, I'm tired but happy. I'm glad I decided to stay open late, because I've made a lot of new friends.
