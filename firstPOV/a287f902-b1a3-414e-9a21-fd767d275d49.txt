I had been working on the lunar construction site for weeks, and I was starting to get used to the eerie stillness of the place. But this morning, something was different. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but there was an uneasiness in the air. I tried to shake it off as I went about my work, but the feeling only grew stronger. And then I heard it. A low, rumbling sound, like something was stirring deep beneath the surface of the moon. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest. What was it? Was something coming for me? I didn't have long to wonder, because in the next instant, the ground beneath my feet began to shake. I stumbled and fell as massive cracks appeared in the ground, and then something began to emerge from the hole. It was a giant creature, unlike anything I had ever seen. It was black and glossy, with dozens of long, segmented legs. It towered over me, its huge eyes glaring down at me. I scrambled to my feet and tried to run, but the creature was faster. It lunged at me, and I felt its sharp teeth sink into my flesh. Then everything went black.
