I was just finishing up my shift at the construction site when I saw my cottage in the distance. I was looking forward to a peaceful night in my country cottage, but when I got closer, I saw a strange light coming from inside. I slowly opened the door to find a group of ghosts dancing around the room. They were laughing and having a good time, and they didn't seem to notice me. I was shocked at first, but then I started to feel like I was intruding on their fun. I was about to leave when one of the ghosts saw me and started to scream. The other ghosts stopped dancing and turned to look at me. They started to advance on me, and I realized I was in trouble. I ran out of the cottage and back to my car, and I didn't look back until I was safely on the road.
