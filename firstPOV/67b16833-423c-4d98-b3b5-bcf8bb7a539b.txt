I'm a software engineer, so I work long hours and often don't get to bed until late at night. I'm up again now, in the middle of the night, pacing back and forth in my bedroom and muttering to myself. I look tired and my hair is a little messy, as if I've been running my hands through it nervously. Every few minutes, I stop pacing and go to sit at my desk, where my laptop is open. I stare at the screen for a minute or two, then open up a new document and start typing furiously. After a few minutes, I close the document and open up another one. I repeat this pattern a few more times, until I finally seem to give up and slam my laptop shut. I sit there for a moment, my head in my hands, before getting up and starting to pace again.
