The sun is setting over the African plains, casting a beautiful orange hue over the landscape. I'm walking home from school, taking in the sights and sounds of the savannah around me. I see some elephants in the distance and hear the calls of lions and other animals I can't identify. As I walk, I think about my day and all the things I have to do when I get home. When I get home, I'm greeted by my mother and father. They ask me about my day and I tell them about my classes and what I learned. After we finish talking, I head to my room to do my homework. I start working on my math assignment, but I can't focus. I keep thinking about the animals I saw on my walk home and how different my life is from theirs. I wonder what it would be like to be one of them, to roam freely and not have to worry about school or homework. I eventually fall asleep at my desk, dreaming of a life in the wild. In my dream, I am transformed into a lioness and I roam the savannah with my family. I hunt and play and enjoy the freedom of being in the wild. When I wake up, I realize that I can't go back to sleep and I decide to go outside and explore my neighborhood. I know I can't turn into a lioness, but I want to feel the wind in my fur and the grass under my paws.
