I cautiously enter the forest, clutching a machete in one hand and a flashlight in the other. I'd been warned about this place by the locals - that it was dark, and deadly. And now, as I shine my light around, I can see why. The trees are close together, forming a canopy that blocks out most of the light. The ground is covered in a thick layer of leaves and twigs, making it difficult to see where I am stepping. Every sound I make echoes eerily through the trees. I have been walking for hours, and I am beginning to get tired and thirsty. I am debating whether to turn back when I hear a noise in the distance. It sounded like... music? I shone my light in the direction of the noise and started walking towards it. As I got closer, I could see a faint light shining through the trees. And then I heard it - laughter. I quickened my pace, and soon I came to a clearing. In the center of the clearing was a small campfire, and around the campfire were five figures, all dressed in strange clothes. They looked up as I approached. "Welcome, Aleksy," one of them said. "We've been expecting you."
