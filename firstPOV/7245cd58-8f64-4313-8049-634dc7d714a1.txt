I was lounging on the lunar surface, enjoying the quiet of the evening. I'd been looking forward to this all day - my husband was working the night shift and the kids were finally in bed. It was nice to have some time to myself. I gazed up at the stars, marveling at the way they seemed so much brighter here on the moon. I remembered the first time I saw them, on my honeymoon. It felt like a lifetime ago. I was glad we'd decided to move out here - it'd been good for the whole family. Suddenly, I heard a noise. It sounded like someone was coming. I got up and dusted myself off, heart racing. I knew I shouldn't be out here by myself - it was against the rules. But I couldn't help but be curious. I peered around a nearby crater and saw a man walking towards me. He was wearing a spacesuit and carrying a rifle. I swallowed hard, not sure what to do. I was about to call out to him when he raised the rifle and pointed it at me. I froze, terror gripping me. I knew I was in trouble now. The man started to speak, but his words were garbled. I couldn't understand what he was saying. He took a step closer and I backed away. Suddenly, he opened fire. I screamed as I felt the bullets tearing into me. I collapsed to the ground, dead. The man walked away, leaving my body behind.
