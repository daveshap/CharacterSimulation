I was working at the bar on the beach, serving drinks to the customers who were sitting there. It was dusk, and the sun was setting. I was wearing a white shirt and black pants. I had a black apron on. I was wearing a white hat. I had a mustache and a beard. I was bald. I was 6 feet tall. I was muscular. I was 30 years old. The customers at the bar were all wearing swimsuits. They were all drinking cocktails. They were all laughing and having a good time. The bar was brightly lit. The music was loud. Suddenly, a group of men came into the bar. They were all wearing masks. They were carrying guns. They started shooting at the customers. I ducked behind the bar. I grabbed a gun from under the counter. I started shooting at the men. I killed two of them. The other men ran away. The customers at the bar were all killed. I was the only one left alive.
