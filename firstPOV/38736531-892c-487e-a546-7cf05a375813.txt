I was busy at work, keeping the place tidy and organized, when I suddenly heard a loud noise. It sounded like something had fallen and shattered. I went to investigate and found that a vase had been knocked over and broken. I looked around to see if anyone is nearby who could have seen what happened, but there was no one in sight. I carefully cleaned up the mess and went back to my work.
