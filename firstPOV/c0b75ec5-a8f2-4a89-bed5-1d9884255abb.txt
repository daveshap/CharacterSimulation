I had just gotten off work from my bartending job and was walking through the office building where I worked to head home for the night. It was the middle of the night and the building was mostly empty, but I still felt a bit on edge as I walked through the darkened halls. I kept thinking I heard someone following me, but every time I turned around there was no one there. Eventually I made it to the exit and breathed a sigh of relief as I stepped outside into the cool night air.
