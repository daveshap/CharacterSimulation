I'm sitting at my desk, working on some reports. The office is quiet and the sun is setting outside. My phone buzzes and I see a text from my husband. He's asking if I'm almost done with work. I reply that I'll be home soon. I finishing up my work and gather my things. As I'm leaving, I see the janitor working in the hallway. I say goodnight to him and head to the elevator. The ride down is uneventful and I step out into the lobby. The security guard nods at me as I walk to the front doors. I push them open and step outside. The air is cool and the sky is dark. I hurry to my car, which is parked in the lot. I get in and drive home, thinking about what I'll make for dinner.
