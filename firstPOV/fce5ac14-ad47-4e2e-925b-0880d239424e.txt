I was just finishing up my shift at the grocery store when I heard a noise coming from the back of the store. I wasn't sure what it was, but it sounded like someone was trying to break in. So I grabbed a can of soup off the shelf and headed towards the back of the store, brandishing it like a weapon. But when I got there, I found that the noise was just a mouse. I let out a sigh of relief and put the soup back on the shelf. Just then, I heard the sound of footsteps on the Moon's surface outside. Someone was coming towards the store. I went to the door and peeked out to see who it was. It was my relief, finally. I unlocked the door and let him in. After I handed over the keys and my store badge, I headed outside and started walking home. It had been a long night, and I was looking forward to getting some sleep.
