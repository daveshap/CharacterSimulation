I'm lying on my bed, scrolling through my phone. I come across a post from a friend that shows her happy family on vacation. I immediately feel a pang of jealousy. I put my phone down and look around my bedroom. It's a typical suburban bedroom with beige walls and a dresser with a mirror. There's a clothes hamper in the corner and a door that leads to a small bathroom. I feel like I'm trapped in this room. I get up from the bed and go to the window. I look out the window and see my neighbor's children playing in the yard. I watch them for a few minutes and then turn away from the window, my heart heavy with sadness.
