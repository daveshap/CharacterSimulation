I was sitting at my desk in my office, working on some papers. I was wearing a suit and tie, and looked very professional. Suddenly, I heard a loud noise outside. I got up to investigate, and saw that the noise was coming from the coffee shop downstairs. I went downstairs to see what was going on, and found that the shop was being robbed! The robbers saw me and started to chase me, but I was able to escape and call the police.
