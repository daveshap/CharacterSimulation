I'm standing on the mountaintop, admiring the view. The sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, painting the sky in a beautiful array of colors. I can see the valley below, where my coffee shop is located. I can see the people beginning to stir, getting ready for their day. I take a deep breath of the fresh mountain air and feel my muscles relax. It's been a long week and I'm looking forward to a day of rest. I've been working hard to get my coffee shop up and running, and it's finally starting to pay off. I head back down the mountain, looking forward to a cup of my own coffee and a quiet day at the shop.
