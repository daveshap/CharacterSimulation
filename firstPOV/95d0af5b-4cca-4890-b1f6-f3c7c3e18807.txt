The sun is just beginning to set as I arrive at the country cottage. I pull to a stop in front of the house and shut off the engine. For a moment, I just sit there, taking in the peaceful surroundings. The cottage is nestled among a group of trees, and the front porch is lined with flowerpots. There is a small path leading up to the front door. I get out of the car and grab the package from the back seat. I walk up to the door and knock. After a moment, the door is opened by a woman in her mid-40s. She has a kind face and is wearing a flowered apron. "Hi, I have a delivery for you," I say, handing her the package. "Thank you," she says, taking it from me. "Have a nice evening," I say, turning to walk back to my car. "You too," she says, closing the door.
