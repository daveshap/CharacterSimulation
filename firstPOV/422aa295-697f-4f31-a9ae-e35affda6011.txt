As I made my rounds, I noticed something strange. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but something seemed off. I cautiously approached the cottage and peered in through the window. Inside, I saw a woman lying on the floor, unmoving. I knew I needed to act fast. I kicked down the door and rushed to her side. She was still breathing, but she was unresponsive. I called 911 and stayed with her until the ambulance arrived. It was a scary moment, but I was glad I was able to help.
