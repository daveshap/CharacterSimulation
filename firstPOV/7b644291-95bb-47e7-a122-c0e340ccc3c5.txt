The darkness of the forest closes in around me as I walk, the afternoon sun filtered through the thick canopy of leaves overhead. I have been walking for hours, ever since I left the safety of the last village I had passed through. My destination is a small cabin deep in the woods that serves as a bar for loggers and hunters who come through this way. I finally arrive at the cabin, tired and sweaty from my hike. I open the door and step inside, relieved to be out of the heat and humidity. The bar is empty, except for a man sitting at one of the tables, nursing a drink. I walk up to the man and ask what he's drinking. The man replies that it's a special concoction made with herbs and spices that he won't tell me about. I shrug and go to the other side of the bar to pour myself a drink. As I sip my drink, I look around the cabin. It's crudely furnished, with a few tables and chairs, and a makeshift bar made out of an old door. There are no windows, and the only light comes from a few candles that are burning on the tables. The door opens and two men come in, laughing and joking with each other. They sit down at the table with the man who wouldn't tell me what he was drinking, and start to play a card game. I lean against the bar and sip my drink, watching the men play cards and trying to ignore the feeling of dread that is building up inside of me.
