I stand beneath the Eiffel Tower, surveying my coffee shop. It's been a busy day, and I'm pleased with the steady stream of customers. I'm especially glad to see so many tourists, as they always tend to spend a little extra. I'm just about to head back inside when I notice a large group of people walking towards me. They're all carrying cameras and Maps, and I can tell they're lost. I smile and wave them over. "Welcome to my shop!" I call out. "Can I help you find something?" The tourists crowd around me, eagerly asking for directions and recommendations. I take my time with each of them, making sure they know exactly where they're going. I know that if I can help them have a great experience in Paris, they'll remember my coffee shop and come back. After a few minutes, the group starts to disperse. I watch them go, feeling proud of my little shop. I know that I've made a difference in their trip, and that's what I love about my job.
