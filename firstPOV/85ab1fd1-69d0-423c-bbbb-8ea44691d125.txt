I was walking through the forest, carrying a bag of groceries. I had been visiting my family in South America and was on my way back to the airport. It was a dark night, and I was having a hard time seeing where I was going. Suddenly, I heard a noise in the trees. I stopped and listened, but I couldn't tell what it was. I started to feel a little scared, so I picked up my pace. Then I heard the noise again, and this time it sounded like it was following me. I started to run, but I was tackled from behind. I hit my head on a tree and everything went black.
