I was enjoying a cup of coffee under the Eiffel Tower when I noticed a young couple walking hand in hand towards the tower. They looked so in love, and I couldn't help but smile at the sight. I was reminded of my own love story, and how my wife and I used to visit the Eiffel Tower on our anniversary. Suddenly, the young couple stopped in front of my coffee shop. They stared at me for a moment, before the woman said, "Excuse me, do you speak English?" I nodded and greeted them warmly. They explained that they were on their honeymoon, and they'd always wanted to visit my coffee shop. They asked if they could take a photo with me, and I was more than happy to oblige. I posed with them for a few photos, and they thanked me before continuing on their way. I watched them go, feeling happy and grateful that I could bring a little bit of happiness to people's lives.
