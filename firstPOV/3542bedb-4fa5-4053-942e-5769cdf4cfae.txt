I hum to myself as I wipe down the tables and chairs, getting ready to close up for the night. I pause now and then to admire the view of the Eiffel Tower, standing tall and imposing against the darkening sky. As dusk settles in, I flip the sign on the door to 'Closed' and lock up. I give the place one last sweeping glance, making sure everything is in its place, before heading off into the night.
