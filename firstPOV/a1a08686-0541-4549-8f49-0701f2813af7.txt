I'm on a research trip in Africa, and the sun is beating down mercilessly on the parched landscape. I'm sweating profusely, and my clothing is sticking to my skin. I'm surrounded by dense jungle, and the only sound is the cicadas chirping in the trees. Suddenly, I hear a loud rustling in the bushes. I freeze, unsure of what to do. A large snake slithers out from the undergrowth and begins to coil itself around me. I'm paralyzed with fear. The snake hisses menacingly and strikes at me with its fangs. I feel a sharp pain in my leg as the venom seeps into my bloodstream. I know I'm in trouble. I try to scream for help, but the venom is already starting to affect my vocal cords. I feel lightheaded and dizzy. I know I need to get help fast, but I don't know where to turn.
