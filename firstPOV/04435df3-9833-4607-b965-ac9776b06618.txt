I'm walking to my job site, a construction site in the middle of nowhere. I'm carrying a large bag of tools over my shoulder, and I'm wearing a hard hat and a reflective vest. I'm sweating already from the heat, and I can see the other workers milling around, getting ready for the day's work. There's a large hole in the ground that will eventually be the foundation for a new building. I walk over to my work station and put down my bag of tools. I pull out a hammer and a nail, and begin working on the building's frame. The day goes by slowly, but eventually the sun starts to set and the work day comes to an end. I put away my tools and trudge back home, tired but satisfaction from a day's work well done.
