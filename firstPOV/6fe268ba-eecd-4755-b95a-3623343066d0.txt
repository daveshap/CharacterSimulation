It's a beautiful day on the moon. The sun is shining and the temperature is perfect. I'm sitting in my coffee shop, enjoying a cup of coffee and a sandwich. I'm looking out the window at the lunar landscape, thinking about the businesses I'm going to have to start on the moon. I've got a lot of work to do, but I'm enjoying the peace and quiet of the moment.
