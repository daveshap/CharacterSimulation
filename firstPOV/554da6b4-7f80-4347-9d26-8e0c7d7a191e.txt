I was just finishing up my shift at the grocery store when I heard a loud crash outside. I went to see what was going on and saw a group of teenagers throwing rocks and graffiti-ing the store's front window. I rushed outside to try and stop them, but they took off running. I was feeling frustrated and angry as I assessed the damage. I was thankful that nobody was hurt, but I knew that it was going to cost a lot of money to fix the window. I just hoped that the insurance would cover it.
