The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow over the quiet beach. I'm sitting on the sand, letting the waves crash over my feet. I've been up for a few hours already, but I like to come to the beach to watch the sunrise and clear my head before starting my day. I work at a small grocery store a few miles from the beach. It's not my dream job, but it pays the bills and I enjoy the people I work with. I've been working there for a little over a year, ever since I moved to Asia to be closer to my family. This is my favorite time of day. I like to sit and watch the world wake up around me. I'm never been a morning person, but something about the peace and quiet of the beach helps me start my day off on the right foot.
