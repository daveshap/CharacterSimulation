I woke up disoriented, unsure of where I was or how I got here. All I knew was that I needed to find my way back home. I started walking, but it was difficult to see where I was going. I tripped over a root and fell to the ground. I looked around and saw a light in the distance. I got up and started walking towards the light. As I got closer, I realized it was a campfire. I saw people sitting around the fire, and I walked up to them. I asked them how to get back home, but they didn't understand me. They started to speak in a different language. I didn't know what to do. I sat down by the fire and tried to think of a way to get home.
