I'm sitting on the edge of a crater, my feet dangling over the edge. I've been working all day, and I'm exhausted. The only sound is the faint buzz of my oxygen tank. I look up at the stars, wondering if anyone is up there looking back at me. I think about my family back on Earth. I miss them, but I know that I'm doing important work. I'm helping to build a new colony on the moon, and one day my children will be able to live here too. Suddenly, I hear a noise. I look around, but I can't see anything. I get to my feet, heart pounding, and start to walk back to the safety of the colony. But whatever was making the noise is following me. I quicken my pace, but whatever it is is gaining on me. I turn to run, but before I can take more than a few steps, something grabs me from behind and drags me into the darkness...
