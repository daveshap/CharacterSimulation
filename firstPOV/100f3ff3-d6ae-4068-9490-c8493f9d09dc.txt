I sit on a bench under the Eiffel Tower, enjoying a quiet moment to myself. I've been wanting to come here for years, and I've finally made it. The Tower is even more impressive in person than I ever could have imagined. As I sit and take in the view, I people-watch and enjoy a quiet lunch. I'm not in a hurry, and I savor every bite of my sandwich. It's a beautiful day, and I'm grateful to have this chance to experience the tower and the city.
