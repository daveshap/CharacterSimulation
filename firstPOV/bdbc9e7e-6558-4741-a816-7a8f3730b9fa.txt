I'm driving my lunar rover across the barren landscape, kicking up dust behind me. I arrive at the outpost and am met by the airlock operator. I hand over the package and am directed to wait in the airlock chamber. I sit down and wait as the chamber is depressurized. Once the pressure is equalized, the door opens and I'm let into the outpost. I'm given a tour of the facility and shown to my quarters. I settle in and prepare for my next delivery.
