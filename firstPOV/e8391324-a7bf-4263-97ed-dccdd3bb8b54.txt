I'm Bob, the coffee shop owner on the moon. I'm all alone here in the middle of the night, with only a pot of coffee brewing for company. I've got a few chairs and a table set up, and I'm just waiting for customers. I've been on the moon for a few weeks now, and business has been slow. I'm starting to wonder if maybe I made a mistake in opening up shop here. But I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm staying open all night, in hopes that someone will come by. I'm not sure who or what I'm expecting, but I'm hopeful nonetheless. I've got the coffee brewing and the chairs set out, and I'm just waiting. I'm not sure what the night will bring, but I'm ready for it.
