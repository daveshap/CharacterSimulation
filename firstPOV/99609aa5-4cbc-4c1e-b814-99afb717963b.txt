I'm standing on a mountaintop in Europe, surrounded by snow-capped peaks. It's lunch time, and I'm enjoying the view from my coffee shop. I can see for miles in every direction, and the air is crisp and clean. I'm surrounded by the sound of birds chirping and the wind blowing through the trees. I take a deep breath and feel alive.
