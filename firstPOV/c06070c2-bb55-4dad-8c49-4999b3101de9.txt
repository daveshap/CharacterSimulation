As I walk home from work, I see the sun start to dip below the horizon. The landscape is beautiful with the orange glow. I hear the animals and insects on the savannah and smell the sweat and dust in the air. I am tired from lifting heavy bags of cement all day. I just want to take a shower and relax. As I get closer to my home, I hear a noise in the bushes. It sounds like someone is crying. I freeze and listen carefully. It is a gazelle caught in a trap. I slowly approach the bushes. The gazelle is bleeding and in pain. I know I can't leave it here. I use my knife to cut the gazelle's leg free from the trap. I apply pressure to the wound to stop the bleeding. I comfort the gazelle until it calms down. I scoop it into my arms and start the long walk to the nearest vet. I know it is going to be a long night, but I made the right decision.
