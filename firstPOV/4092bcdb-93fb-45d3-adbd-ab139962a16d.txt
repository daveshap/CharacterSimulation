I can see the Eifel Tower in the distance and it looks beautiful today. I'm busy serving coffee and pastries to my customers in my small shop when I notice a large group of tourists walking by. I know that this is the lunch rush and I'm prepared for it. I've got extra coffee and pastries on hand, and I'm ready to serve my customers with a smile. I know that many of them will be stopping by my shop to take a break from sightseeing and I want to make sure they enjoy their time here. As the group approaches, I can see that they're all carrying cameras and maps, and I know they're looking for a place to rest and refuel. I'm ready to welcome them into my shop and give them the best service possible.
