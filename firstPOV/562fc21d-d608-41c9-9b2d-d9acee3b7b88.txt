It was a hot day in Paris, and I was working at the bar under the Eiffel Tower. The lunch crowd had just come in and I was busy making drinks. I could see the tourists walking around the tower, taking pictures and enjoying the view. I always loved working in this spot because it was so beautiful. Suddenly, I heard a commotion coming from the other side of the bar. I turned to see a group of people arguing with each other. They were speaking in a language I didn't understand, but I could tell they were angry. I tried to stay out of it, but one of the men pushed me and I spilled a drink on the floor. That's when all hell broke loose. The men started fighting with each other and I was caught in the middle. I tried to break it up, but they were too strong. Suddenly, I felt a sharp pain in my side and I fell to the ground. I could see the men still fighting, but everything was starting to fade to black. I knew I was going to die. The last thing I saw was the Eiffel Tower standing tall above me.
