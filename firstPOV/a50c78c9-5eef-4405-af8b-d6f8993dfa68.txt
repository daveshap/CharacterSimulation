I'm walking through a dark forest in South America. It's 6pm and the sun is beginning to set. I'm carrying a large backpack and I'm wearing a bright red coat. I'm sweating and panting as I walk, and my breath is visible in the cold air. I seem to be following a path through the forest, although it's difficult to see in the dim light. I've been walking for some time, and I'm beginning to feel tired and thirsty. I stop for a rest and take a drink from my water bottle. As I do, I hear a noise in the distance. It sounds like someone is crying. I begin to follow the sound and soon come to a clearing in the Forest. In the clearing is a small cabin, and in front of the cabin is a young woman. The woman is kneeling on the ground, and her face is buried in her hands. She's sobbing uncontrollably. I approach the woman and ask her if she's okay. The woman doesn't respond, and I can see that she's in a state of shock. I take off my backpack and open it, and take out a blanket. I wrap the woman in the blanket and help her to her feet. I lead her into the cabin and sit her down in a chair. I then rummage through my backpack and take out a first aid kit. I tend to the woman's cuts and bruises and give her a drink of water. The woman is still in a state of shock but she's beginning to calm down. She tells me her name is Sarah and she tells me what happened. She says she was hiking in the forest with her boyfriend when they were attacked by a group of men. Sarah's boyfriend was killed, and she was raped and beaten. The men left her for dead, but she managed to crawl to the cabin. I comfort Sarah and tell her she's safe now. I say I'll stay with her until morning and then I'll take her to the nearest town. Sarah thanks me and begins to cry again.
