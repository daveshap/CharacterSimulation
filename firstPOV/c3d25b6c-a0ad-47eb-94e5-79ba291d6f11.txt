I was getting dark, and I knew I had to find someplace to camp for the night. I had been walking through the forest for hours, and I was getting tired. I saw a light up ahead, and I walked towards it. When I got closer, I saw that it was a campfire. There were people around the fire, and they were speaking a language that I didn't understand. I didn't want to intrude, so I started to walk away. One of the people saw me and called out to me in English. I walked over to the fire and introduced myself. The people were friendly, and they offered me some food and a place to sleep for the night. I was grateful, and I accepted their offer. I sat down by the fire and ate the food they gave me. Then I lay down and went to sleep.
