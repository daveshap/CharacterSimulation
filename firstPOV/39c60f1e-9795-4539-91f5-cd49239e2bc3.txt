I'm sitting on the edge of a crater, eating my lunch and enjoying the view. I'm wearing a spacesuit and helmet, and I'm surrounded by the desolate, airless landscape of the moon. In the distance, I can see the Earth, a bright blue and green orb hanging in the blackness of space. I've been working on the lunar base for the past year, and I'm looking forward to going home soon. But for now, I'm content to sit in the silence and enjoy the peace of being alone on the moon.
