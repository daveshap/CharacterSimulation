I had always wanted to see the Eifel Tower. It was one of the most iconic structures in the world, and it was right there in my city. So when I got off work from the grocery store late one night, I decided to take a walk over to it. The streets were mostly empty at this time of night, and I felt a bit nervous as I made my way towards the tower. But as I got closer, I started to feel more excited. And when I finally arrived at the base of the tower, I couldn't help but stare up at it in awe. It was even more impressive up close than I had ever imagined. I stood there for a few minutes, just taking it all in, before I finally decided to head back home. But as I turned to go, I heard a noise coming from one of the alleyways nearby. I hesitated for a moment, not sure whether I should investigate or not. But then I thought, if there's someone in trouble, I should help. So I cautiously made my way towards the alley. As I got closer, I could see that there was a group of men standing there. And they didn't look friendly. I was about to turn and run the other way when one of the men spotted me. "Hey, you! Come here!" I had no choice but to go towards them. As I got closer, I could see that they were holding someone captive. A young woman was standing there, looking terrified. The men started to jeer and catcall me as I approached. They were clearly drunk, and I could see that they were about to start harassing the woman. I knew I had to do something. But I was so outnumbered and outmatched. I didn't know how I was going to get them to stop.
