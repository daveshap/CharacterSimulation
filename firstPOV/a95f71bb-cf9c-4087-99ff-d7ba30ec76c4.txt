I'm Aleksy, a grocery store clerk who lives in a small bedroom. It's evening, and I'm just getting home from work. I'm tired and hope to get some sleep. I enter my room and see that my bed is unmade. I don't see my pillow or blanket. I wonder where they could be. I look around the room and see that my window is open. I walk over to the window and look outside. I see my pillow and blanket on the ground. I wonder how they got there. I look up and see that my window is on the second story. I don't see anyone in the street. I wonder how my pillow and blanket got on the ground. I decide to go to bed and will worry about it in the morning.
