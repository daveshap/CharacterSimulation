I had always wanted to see the mountaintops of Europe. They had always looked so peaceful and calming in the pictures I had seen. And now here I was, standing on one myself. I took a deep breath in and closed my eyes, savoring the moment. The sun was just beginning to set, casting a beautiful pink and orange hue in the sky. I felt like I could stay here forever. Suddenly, I heard a noise in the distance. It sounded like someone was crying. I followed the sound until I came to a clearing. And there I saw a woman, sitting on the ground, her face in her hands. I approached her cautiously. "Hello? Are you okay?" The woman looked up at me, her eyes red and swollen from crying. "No," she said, her voice shaking. "I'm not okay." I sat down next to her and put a comforting hand on her back. "It's going to be alright," I said softly. "Whatever it is, we'll figure it out." The woman took a deep breath and began to tell me her story. She had come up here to see the sunset, just like I had. But she had gotten lost on the way back down. She had been walking for hours, and she was starting to get cold and hungry. I listened sympathetically as she spoke. Then I stood up and held out my hand to her. "Come on," I said. "I'll take you back to my village. We'll get you something to eat and a warm place to sleep." The woman took my hand and I helped her to her feet. Together, we began the walk back down the mountain.
