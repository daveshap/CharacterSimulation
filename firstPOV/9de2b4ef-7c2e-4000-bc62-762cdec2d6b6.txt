The sun is beating down on the sand, making it hot to the touch. I'm walking along the water's edge, admiring the view. The ocean is a deep blue, and the sky is a bright, clear blue. There are some small waves crashing against the shore. I can see some people in the distance, but I am alone for the moment. I am wearing a white sundress and sandals. My hair is pulled back in a low ponytail. I have a small backpack with me. Suddenly, I hear someone calling my name. I turn to see my friend, Ravi, running towards me. He is wearing shorts and a t-shirt. He has a big smile on his face. "Swathi! I'm so glad I found you!" he says. "Ravi, what are you doing here?" I ask, surprised. "I took a bus down from the city. I wanted to see you!" he says. "That's so sweet of you!" I say, giving him a hug. We walk along the beach, talking and laughing. The wind blows through our hair and the waves crash against the shore. We are happy to be together again.
