I'm out for a morning walk with my baby in the stroller when I see a commotion up ahead. I slow down to see what's going on and I see a group of people gathered around a newsstand, reading the latest headlines. I can't help but overhear snippets of their conversation. "Can you believe it? Another terrorist attack in London." "I know. I'm scared to even fly anymore." "These crazy Muslims are going to ruin the world." I quicken my pace, not wanting to get caught up in their worrisome conversation. I have enough to worry about with a young child at home. I don't need to add international terrorism to my list of concerns.
