I climb to the top of the mountain, gasping for breath in the thin air. I reach the summit just as the sun is setting, painting the sky in a beautiful array of colors. I look out over the valley below, taking in the sights and sounds of the peaceful countryside. I feel a sense of calm and tranquility wash over me. Suddenly, I hear a noise behind me. I turn to see a large bird swooping down towards me. I try to run, but the bird is too fast. It grabs me in its claws and lifts me into the air. I scream as I am carried away into the night.
