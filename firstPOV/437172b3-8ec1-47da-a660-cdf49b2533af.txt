I'm in the middle of the chaos, delivering food to the concession stands. I weave my way through the crowd, dodging flying elbows and dancing feet. The noise is deafening, but I'm used to it. I've been delivering food to this concert venue for years, and I know the layout like the back of my hand. I make my way to the concession stand, where the workers are busy keeping up with the demand. I hand over the food and get a few thank-yous from the workers. I smile and nod, then turn to go back out into the maelstrom. I have to shout to be heard over the music as I ask the workers how their night is going. The concert goes on late into the night, but I don't mind. I'm happy to be doing what I love - delivering food to people who are enjoying themselves. I know that when the concert is over, I'll be able to get some rest. But for now, I'm content to keep dancing and delivering.
