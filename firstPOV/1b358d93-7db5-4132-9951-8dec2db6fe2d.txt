As the sun began to set, the concertgoers started to fill the arena. I, a delivery driver, was stuck in the middle of the crowd. I tried to move but it was impossible. I was surrounded by people dancing and singing. The music was so loud that I could feel it vibrating through my body. I closed my eyes and tried to enjoy the moment, but after a while, I started to feel claustrophobic. I started to sweat and my heart started to race. I tried to push my way through the crowd but it was impossible. I started to feel lightheaded and dizzy. I tried to scream for help but no one could hear me. I felt like I was going to pass out. Suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder and I was pulled out of the crowd. I could breathe again. I opened my eyes and saw a security guard standing next to me. The guard told me to go to the first aid station. I nodded and tried to stand up but my legs were weak. The guard helped me to the first aid station where I was given some water and a place to sit down.
