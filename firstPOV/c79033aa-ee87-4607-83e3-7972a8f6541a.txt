I step out onto the porch and take a deep breath of the fresh morning air. The sun is just starting to peek over the horizon, and the birds are stirring in the trees. I've been so busy lately, with the kids and the house and just trying to keep everything together. It feels good to finally have a moment to myself. I walk down the steps and into the garden, admiring the flowers that are just starting to bloom. Suddenly, I hear a noise from the other side of the hedge. It sounds like someone is crying. I hesitate for a moment, unsure of what to do. But then I remember the time when I was in a similar situation, and how someone had helped me when I needed it most. So I walk around the hedge, and come face to face with a young woman, who is sobbing uncontrollably. I don't know what to say, so I just put my arms around her and let her cry.
