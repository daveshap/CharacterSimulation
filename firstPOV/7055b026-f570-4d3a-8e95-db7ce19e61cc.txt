The sun is setting on the quiet beach, and I'm taking a well-deserved break from my job at the grocery store. I've been working all day, and I'm exhausted, but the peaceful setting and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore is helping me to relax. I'm lying on my back, eyes closed, soaking up the last of the day's warmth. Suddenly, I hear a noise that startles me. I open my eyes and see a figure walking towards me. As the figure gets closer, I realize that it's a woman. She's wearing a flowing white dress that looks like it's made of silk, and her long dark hair is blowing in the breeze. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. The woman comes to a stop next to me, and she looks down at me with a gentle smile. "Hello," she says in a soft voice. "I'm sorry if I disturbed you." "It's okay," I reply, my heart racing. "I was just enjoying the sunset." The woman nods. "It is beautiful, isn't it? I love watching the sun set over the ocean." I nod, too lost in the woman's beauty to say anything else. After a few moments, the woman speaks again. "My name is Lily. What's your name?" "Aleksy," I reply. Lily smiles. "It's nice to meet you, Aleksy. I hope you have a nice evening." With that, she turns and walks away, leaving me alone on the beach, wondering if I'm just dreaming.
