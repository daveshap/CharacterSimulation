I'm Wang, a delivery driver, and I'm making a delivery to an office building. It's dusk, and the office building is lit up with bright lights. I pull up to the building and park my car. I get out of my car and go to the back to get the package I'm delivering. I pick up the package and start to walk towards the building. I notice that there are people in the parking lot who are not working in the building. They are loitering and talking to each other. I wonder why they are there. I start to feel uneasy. I continue walking towards the building. As I get closer, I can see that the glass doors are shattered. I can hear people inside the building shouting. I realize that there is a robbery going on. I start to run back to my car. I hear gunshots behind me. I get to my car and drive away as fast as I can.
