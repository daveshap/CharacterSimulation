The sky is a deep black, punctured by a million stars. The horizon is a sharp line, dividing the inky sky from the equally dark surface of the moon. I'm driving my delivery truck across the lunar landscape. I've been on the job for hours, and I'm getting tired. I have a few more deliveries to make before I can call it a day. The truck lurches to a stop. I curse under my breath. I know I should have gotten the truck serviced before undertaking this job. I'm going to have to walk the rest of the way. I climb out of the truck and start walking. I'm not sure how far I have to go, but I know it's not far. I've been making these deliveries for weeks, and I've gotten to know the terrain well. The ground is uneven and rocky. I have to watch my step so I don't trip and fall. I'm getting close to my destination. I can see the lights of the research station in the distance. I'm almost there when I hear a noise. I stop and listen, but I can't quite place it. It sounds like something is moving around in the rocks. I start to feel uneasy. I'm about to turn back when I see a pair of eyes shine in the darkness. I freeze. I'm not sure what to do. The eyes move closer, and I can see that they belong to a large creature. The creature is definitely not human. I have no idea what it is. I've never seen anything like it before. The creature is moving closer and I am paralyzed with fear. I'm about to turn and run when the creature speaks. "Hello," it says. "I'm not going to hurt you." I am so surprised that I don't know what to say. "I'm just here to deliver a message," the creature continues. "You need to leave this place. It's not safe here anymore." I am still in shock, but I manage to nod. "Okay," I say. "I'll go." The creature nods and then disappears back into the darkness. I don't know what to think. I've never seen anything like that before. I start to walk back to the truck, but I can't shake the feeling that something is watching me.
