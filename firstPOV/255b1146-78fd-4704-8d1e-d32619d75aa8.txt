I was working the evening shift at the grocery store when I got a call from my wife. She was frantic and told me to come home right away. I rushed out of the store and drove home as fast as I could. When I arrived, I found my wife in the backyard, surrounded by our three kids. She was crying and shaking uncontrollably. My mind raced as I tried to figure out what was going on. Then I saw it. There was a large, black snake coiled up next to my wife. It was easily the biggest snake I had ever seen. My heart sank as I realized what was happening. I slowly approached the snake, careful not to make any sudden moves. My wife was still terrified, but I did my best to calm her down. I slowly inched closer to the snake, then grabbed it behind the head. I carefully pulled it away from my wife and kids, then threw it as far away from them as I could. My wife collapsed into my arms, relieved and grateful that I had arrived when I did. We both knew that it could have ended much worse if I hadn't been there.
