I enter my bedroom and flop down on my bed. I stare up at the ceiling, lost in thought. My mind is racing and I can't seem to focus on anything. I'm trying to study for my upcoming biology test, but I can't seem to concentrate. Suddenly, my phone buzzes. I sit up and grab it, eager for a distraction. It's a text from my best friend, asking if I want to come over and hang out. I respond quickly, saying I'll be right there. I stand up and grab my jacket, then head for the door. I paused for a moment, hand on the doorknob, and take a deep breath. I can do this. I'm just a little stressed, that's all. I can't let my anxiety get the best of me. I open the door and step out into the hallway, then head for my friend's house.
