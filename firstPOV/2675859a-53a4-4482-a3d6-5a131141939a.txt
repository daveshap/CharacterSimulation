I'm in the middle of a concert and I'm surrounded by people who are all cheering and singing along to the music. The air is thick with the smell of beer and sweat, but I'm dancing and Having a great time. I'm wearing a tank top and shorts. My hair is curly and wild. I have a smile on my face and I'm surrounded by friends. It's an amazing feeling.
