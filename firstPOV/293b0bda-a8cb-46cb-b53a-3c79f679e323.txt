I'm driving my delivery truck through the city, making my way through the traffic. The streets are brightly lit and there's a lot of noise. I make my way through the city, making deliveries and picking up packages. I eventually make it to the outskirts of the city, where I make my final delivery. I then drive back to the city and park my truck in a garage.
