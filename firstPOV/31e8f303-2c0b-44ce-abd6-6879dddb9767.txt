I'm in my bedroom, getting ready for bed. I'm wearing a tank top and shorts, and my hair is pulled back in a ponytail. I'm just about to turn off the light when I hear a noise downstairs. I freeze, listening carefully. It sounds like someone is walking around in the living room. My heart starts to race. I'm not sure what to do. Should I go downstairs and see who it is, or should I stay upstairs and call the police? After a moment of deliberation, I decide to call the police. I quietly grab my phone and start to dial, but before I can finish, I hear someone coming up the stairs. I quickly turn off the light and hide under the covers, trying to make myself as small as possible. I hear the person enter the room and come towards the bed. My heart is pounding in my chest. I'm petrified with fear. Suddenly, the person speaks. "Sandy, it's me. Don't be afraid." I recognize the voice as my husband's. I let out a sigh of relief and come out from under the covers. "Oh, thank goodness," I say. "You scared me half to death." "I'm sorry," he replies. "I didn't mean to scare you. I just forgot my keys and thought I'd try to find them before coming upstairs." "Well, you certainly succeeded in giving me a good scare," I say, laughing. "Next time, just come upstairs and let me know it's you. You don't have to sneak around in the dark." "I will," he says. "I'm sorry again for scaring you." "It's okay," I say, forgiving him. "I love you." "I love you too," he says, before giving me a kiss goodnight.
