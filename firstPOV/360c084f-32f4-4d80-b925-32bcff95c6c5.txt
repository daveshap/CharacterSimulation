I had been working the night shift at the grocery store for nearly a year now, and I was used to the ebb and flow of the late-night customers. But tonight, things were different. It was dead quiet. Not a single soul had come in or out of the store in hours. The stillness was unnerving. I tried to take my mind off of it by straightening up the shelves and mopping the floors, but eventually I ran out of things to do. I leaned against the counter and watched the minutes tick by on the clock, longing for the shift to end. Suddenly, I heard a noise coming from the back of the store. Something was moving around in the stockroom. My heart started to race. I had never been back there alone at night before, and the thought of someone else being in the store with me was terrifying. I slowly made my way to the back, my hand trembling as I reached for the light switch. I flipped it on, and the stockroom was immediately bathed in light. I swallowed hard, mustering up the courage to take a step into the room. But before I could take even one step, I heard the back door swing open. Someone was coming in. My heart was pounding in my chest as I cowered in the stockroom, waiting for the intruders to make their way into the store. But instead of the footsteps I was expecting, I heard a strange, ethereal voice. "Aleksy," the voice said. "We've been waiting for you."
