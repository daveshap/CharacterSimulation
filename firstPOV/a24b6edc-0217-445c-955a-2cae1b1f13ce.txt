The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon, casting a warm and welcoming glow over the quaint country cottage. I, Tom the bartender, had just finished my shift and was looking forward to heading home to my family. The cottage was located just outside of town, surrounded by open fields and tall trees. The peace and quiet was a welcome change after the hustle and bustle of the bar. I unlocked the door and stepped inside, taking a deep breath of the fresh, clean air. Everything was just as I had left it the night before. I made my way to the kitchen, where my wife was already busy preparing breakfast. We exchanged a warm embrace and sat down to enjoy a quiet meal together. After breakfast, I headed out to the porch to enjoy the rest of my morning. I breathed in the fresh air and felt the warm sun on my face. It was going to be a beautiful day.
