I'm walking through the dark forest, my construction worker's hat providing little light. I'm trying to find my way back to the camp site. It's getting dark and I'm starting to feel lost. I hear something in the distance and start to run. I'm running towards the noise, which is getting louder and closer. I can see a light up ahead and think I've found my way back. As I get closer, I realize that the light is coming from a campfire. I can see people around the fire, and they're all looking at me. I start to feel uneasy and decide to turn back the way I came. As I turn, I see a large animal standing in my path. It's a jaguar, and it's looking right at me.
