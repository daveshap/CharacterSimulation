I'm sitting on the porch of a small hut, watching over a group of sleeping children. The night is warm and the air is filled with the sounds of insects and animals. I'm on edge, my eyes scanning the darkness for any sign of danger. I know that lions sometimes roam this part of Africa, and I don't want any of the children to be harmed. Suddenly, I hear a rustling in the bushes. I tense up, my heart racing as I prepare to defend the children. However, instead of a lion, a small rabbit hops out from the undergrowth. I let out a sigh of relief and relax back into my chair. I continue to watch over the children, my mind drifting back to my own childhood in Africa. I remember the nights I would sit on my porch, watching over my little brothers and sisters as they slept. I would always be on the lookout for any danger, ready to protect my loved ones. I feel a deep sense of love and protectiveness for the children I'm watching over tonight. I know that they are safe in my care, and I will do whatever it takes to keep them safe.
