The door seals shut behind me and I feel a sudden jolt. There's a hissing sound as the air is pumped out of the room. I start to feel lightheaded and dizzy. I know I need to get to the emergency oxygen tanks, but my body feels so heavy. I try to take a step forward, but my legs won't move. I fall to the ground, unconscious. The last thing I hear is the alarm sounding as the airlock begins to fill with oxygen.
