I'm scaling the Eiffel Tower in the middle of the night. I've been working construction on it for months, so I know every inch of it. I'm one of the few people who is brave enough to climb it in the middle of the night. I'm drawn to the top of the tower for some reason. Maybe it's because I can see the whole city from up there. Maybe it's because it makes me feel like I'm on top of the world. Whatever the reason, I know I have to make it to the top. The climb is treacherous, and more than once I slip and nearly fall. But I finally make it to the top, and the view takes my breath away. I can see the entire city stretched out before me, lights twinkling in the distance. I feel like I could stay there forever. But I know I can't. I have to get back down before anyone sees me. It's not safe to be up here, and I could get in a lot of trouble if I'm caught. So I take one last look at the view and then start the long climb back down.
