I was sitting at my desk in my office, working on some software code. I'd been working on this project for weeks and was getting close to finishing it. I was feeling good about my progress and was confident I'd be able to finish it within the next few days. Suddenly, my manager walked into my office and told me that my project had been cancelled. I was stunned. I couldn't believe it. I had been working so hard on this project and was so close to finishing it. My manager tried to explain the situation to me, but I was devastated. I didn't want to hear it. I started packing up my things, trying to hold back the tears. As I was leaving the office, I ran into one of my coworkers. They asked me what was wrong and I told them the news. I couldn't believe it. I was so upset and didn't know what I was going to do now.
