I'm lying in my bed, wide awake. It's the middle of the night, and I can't seem to fall asleep. I toss and turn, trying to get comfortable, but it's no use. I look over at the alarm clock and sigh. 3:00 AM. I've been trying to sleep for hours now, but my mind just won't shut off. I get out of bed and go to the window, looking out at the darkened street below. I wonder what it would be like to just walk out of my house and start exploring the world. I've never been very adventurous, but the thought of just leaving everything behind is strangely appealing. I watch as a car drives by, its headlights illuminating the road for a moment before disappearing into the night. I wonder what it's like to be out there, driving around with nowhere to go. I long for something more, but I don't know what that is. I feel trapped in my life, like I'm stuck in a rut. I know I need to make a change, but I don't know how. I stare out the window for a while, lost in thought, before finally going back to bed.
