I'm walking along the beach, enjoying the peacefulness of the scene. My feet sink into the sand with each step. Suddenly, I hear a noise behind me. I turn around and see a large dark shape coming towards me. I start to run, but the thing is faster. It catches up to me and knocks me to the ground. I feel something sharp piercing my skin and cry out in pain. The last thing I see before I black out is the creature's face, with its large teeth and red eyes.
