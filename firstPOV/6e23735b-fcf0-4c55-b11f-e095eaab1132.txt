I always loved hiking, and when I found out my family would be spending a summer in Europe, I was determined to explore as many mountain trails as possible. So far, I had climbed some of the largest peaks in the Alps, and today I was setting my sights on one of the smaller ones. The sun was starting to set by the time I reached the top of the mountain, but I wanted to enjoy the view for a little while longer before starting my descent. I sat down on a large rock and took in the sight of the valley below, the sleepy villages nestled among the rolling hills. It was so peaceful up here, I thought to myself. I could understand why people loved to come to the mountains to get away from the hustle and bustle of daily life. After a few minutes, I got up and started to make my way back down the trail. I had only gone a few steps when I heard a rustling in the bushes. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest. Could it be a wild animal? I didn't know if there were any dangerous animals in these mountains, but I didn't want to take any chances. Slowly, I started to back away from the bushes, but before I could get too far, a man stepped out from behind them. I gasped and took a step back. The man was holding a knife, and he had a sinister look in his eyes. I knew I was in trouble. There was no one around for miles, and I didn't know how to defend myself against a knife. I tried to think of something, anything, that could help me get out of this situation, but my mind was blank. The man took a step towards me, and I stepped back again. I knew I was going to have to think of something fast.
