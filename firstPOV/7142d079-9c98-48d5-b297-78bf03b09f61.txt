I finish my last job of the day, babysitting for a family with two young kids. It's been a long day, and I'm ready to go home and relax. I gather my things and head for the door, but before I can reach it, I hear a noise coming from the other side. It sounds like someone is trying to break in. I quickly grab a nearby lamp and hide behind the door, heart racing. I wait for a few moments, but the noise doesn't stop. It sounds like the person is getting closer. Just as the person is about to reach the door, I swing the lamp at them, knocking them out cold. I then call the police and wait for them to arrive.
