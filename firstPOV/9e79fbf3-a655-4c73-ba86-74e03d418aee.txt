I'm a software engineer who works in an office building. It's 6pm and I'm still working on my computer. I'm very tired and my eyes are starting to hurt. I rub my eyes and then get up to stretch my legs. I leave my office and walk down the hall to the elevators. I press the button to go down to the lobby and then get in. The elevator starts to descend and I close my eyes for a moment. When I open them again, I realize that the elevator has stopped and the lights are off. I press the button to try to make it go down again, but nothing happens. I start to feel a little anxious and start to bang on the elevator door. After a few minutes, I take out my phone to call my husband. "Hello? honey, I'm stuck in the elevator. Can you come and get me?" I then hear footsteps approach and someone starts to fiddle with the elevator door. I breathe a sigh of relief as the door opens and my husband steps in. "Come on, let's get you out of here."
