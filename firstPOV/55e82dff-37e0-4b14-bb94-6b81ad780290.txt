I enter my bedroom and close the door behind me, starting to undress. I take off my work clothes and hang them up neatly, changing into a pair of comfortable pajamas. I climb into bed and let out a contented sigh, grateful to finally be able to relax. I close my eyes and soon fall asleep, dreaming of better days to come.
