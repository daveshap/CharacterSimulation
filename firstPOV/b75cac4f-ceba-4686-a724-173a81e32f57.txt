I was walking along the beach, enjoying the quiet night. I was carrying a backpack full of supplies, and I was headed to a nearby island. The island was a popular tourist destination, but it was currently deserted. I was planning to set up a bar on the island, and I was looking forward to having the place to myself. As I approached the island, I saw a light coming from the beach. Someone was already on the island! I dropped my backpack and ran towards the light. I arrived to find a young woman setting up a campfire. I was surprised to see someone on the island, but I was happy to have the company. I introduced myself to the woman, and we chatted for a while by the fire.
