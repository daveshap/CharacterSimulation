I was on my lunch break on a mountaintop in Europe. Mid-afternoon, the sun was shining and the breeze was blowing. I was enjoying the view when I heard a noise. I looked over and saw a rock slide coming down the mountain. I had just enough time to get out of the way before the rocks came tumbling down.
