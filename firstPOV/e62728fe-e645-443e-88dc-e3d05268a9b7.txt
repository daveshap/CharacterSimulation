I'm standing in the middle of a crowded concert hall, surrounded by people dancing and singing along to the music. I'm holding a cup of coffee in one hand and a book in the other, and I look like I'm enjoying myself immensely. I'm tapping my foot along to the beat and swaying slightly from side to side, and every now and then I take a sip of my coffee. I'm clearly in my element here, surrounded by the music and the people.
