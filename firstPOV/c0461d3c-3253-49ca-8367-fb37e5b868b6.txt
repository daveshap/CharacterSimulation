I'm Swathi, a software engineer from India. I'm currently living in Paris, and today I decided to walk to the Eiffel Tower to have lunch. As I approached the tower, I could see the long line of people waiting to go up to the top. I decided to walk around the tower instead, admiring its size and beauty. After finishing my lunch, I took a few pictures of the tower before heading back to work.
