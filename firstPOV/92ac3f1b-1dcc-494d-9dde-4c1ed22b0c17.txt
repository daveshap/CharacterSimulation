I'm working as a grocery store clerk on a busy lunchtime shift. I've been working hard all morning, and I'm starting to feel pretty tired. I'm just about to take my break when I see a customer coming towards me. The customer, a young woman, looks around the store for a moment before coming up to me. She seems a bit nervous, and I can see that she's holding a small, delicate object in her hand. The woman asks me for help in finding something, and I do my best to assist her. However, I can tell that she's still quite nervous, and I wonder what she's holding in her hand. Finally, the woman finds what she's looking for, and she thanks me before quickly leaving the store. I watch her go, curious about the object she was holding.
