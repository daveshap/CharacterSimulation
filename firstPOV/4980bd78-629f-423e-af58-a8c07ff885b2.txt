I was driving my delivery truck through the city when I got caught in the middle of a massive concert. Thousands of people were cheering and singing along to the music, which was blasting from huge speakers all around me. My truck was surrounded by people dancing and jumping up and down, and I could barely move forward. I honked my horn and tried to inch my way through the crowd, but it was impossible. I was finally forced to stop and wait it out until the concert ended.
