I was tending to the lunchtime crowd at the cottage when I noticed a disturbance outside. I looked out the window to see a group of men on horseback, brandishing swords and shields, charging towards the cottage. I quickly ushered all the customers into the back room and barred the door. I then grabbed a sword from the wall and positioned myself at the front window, ready to defend the cottage. The men on horseback surrounded the cottage and began pounding on the door. I shouted for them to go away, but they only laughed in response. The men threw themselves against the door, but I held it firm. Suddenly, one of the men broke through the window and leapt into the cottage. I reacted quickly, running him through with my sword. The other men seeing their comrade fall, began to back away. I shouted after them, warning them not to come back or I would kill them all. The men quickly mounted their horses and rode away, leaving me victorious.
