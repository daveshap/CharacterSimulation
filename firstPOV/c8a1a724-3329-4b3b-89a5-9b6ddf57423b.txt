I was lying on my bed, staring at the ceiling, when I heard a knock at the door. I got up and opened it, and I was surprised to see my boss, Mr. Kowalski. He was holding an envelope in his hand. "Aleksy," he said. "I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but we're going to have to let you go." I was stunned. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. "But why?" I asked. "I'm sorry," Mr. Kowalski said. "It's just not working out. We're going to have to let you go." I couldn't believe it. I'd been working at the grocery store for years, and I'd never been in trouble. I'd always been a good employee. "I'm sorry, Aleksy," Mr. Kowalski said. "but you'll have to leave immediately. I'll have someone come and collect your things." I was heartbroken. I couldn't believe I was being fired. I didn't know what I was going to do.
