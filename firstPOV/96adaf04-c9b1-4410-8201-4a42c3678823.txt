I'm driving my delivery truck along a dirt road in Africa. It's getting dark and I'm getting tired. I've been driving for hours, and I still have a long way to go. I'm not sure if I'll make it to my destination before nightfall. Suddenly, my truck hits a pothole and I hear a loud bang. I know I've blown a tire. I pull over to the side of the road and get out to assess the damage. It's getting very dark now, and I'm starting to get worried. I don't have a spare tire, and I'm not sure what I'll do. I'm considering trying to walk to the nearest town, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to find my way in the dark. Suddenly, I hear a noise in the distance. It sounds like it's coming from the direction I was heading. I'm not sure what it is, but I know I shouldn't stick around to find out. I start to run in the opposite direction, and I don't look back.
