The crowd is electric, jumping and cheering as the band plays their final song. I'm in the middle of the mosh pit, surrounded by sweaty bodies bumping into me from all sides. I'm elbowing and pushing my way through the crowd, trying to get closer to the stage. I can see the band members' faces now, they're dripping with sweat and grinning from ear to ear. I'm so close, I can reach out and touch them. Suddenly, the music stops and the lights come on. I blink, trying to adjust to the sudden brightness. The crowd around me starts to disperse, and I realize the concert is over. I'm disappointed, but also a little relieved. My arms and legs are sore from all the pushing and elbow-throwing. As I make my way out of the venue, I spot a group of my friends. They wave me over, and I join them as they head to the after-party.
