I was in the middle of making lunch for the kids I was babysitting when I heard a loud noise coming from upstairs. I quickly finished making the sandwiches and ran upstairs to see what was going on. I found the two kids in the bathroom, with one of them trying to flush the other one down the toilet. I quickly pulled the child out of the toilet and scolded the other one for trying to flush her down the toilet. I then helped the child who was in the toilet to the bathroom and got them cleaned up. After that, I made sure that the bathroom was cleaned up and then went back to making lunch.
