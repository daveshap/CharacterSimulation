I was walking home from school, it was a hot day and I was sweating by the time I got home. I was about to go inside when I heard a noise in the bushes. I froze, thinking it might be a wild animal. But then I heard a voice call my name. I relaxed when I realized it was just my friend, Sarah. "What are you doing here?" I asked. "I needed to talk to you," Sarah said. "It's about the test." I groaned. I had completely forgotten about the test we were taking tomorrow. "I'm so sorry," I said. "I totally forgot." "It's okay," Sarah said. "I've been studying. I can help you." So we spent the next couple of hours studying together. By the time we were done, I felt a lot better about the test. "Thank you so much," I said. "You're welcome," Sarah said. "Just remember, we're in this together."
