As I enter the bedroom, I see the customer lying in bed, with a tray of food next to them. I feel a pang of jealousy as I realise that the customer is about to enjoy a delicious-looking meal, while I will have to wait until I get back to the delivery depot to eat. I quickly deposit the delivery in the bedroom and then leave, my stomach growling.
