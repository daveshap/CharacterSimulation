I wake up in the middle of the night, my heart pounding in my chest. I can hear strange noises coming from outside my bedroom window. cautiously, I get out of bed and creep to the window, peeking out through the curtains. I can see shadowy figures moving around in the backyard and my blood runs cold. I know I should call the police, but I'm too scared to move. I stand there frozen, heart racing, until the figures finally disappear into the night. I'm relieved, but shaken. I quietly go back to bed and try to go back to sleep, but my mind is racing and I can't seem to shake the feeling that someone is watching me.
