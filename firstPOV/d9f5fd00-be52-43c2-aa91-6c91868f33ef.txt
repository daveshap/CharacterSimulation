I'm working at the bar beneath the Eiffel Tower, and the place is packed. It's a beautiful night out and everyone's in a great mood. I'm wearing my white shirt and black pants, and I'm busy pouring drinks and serving food. The customers are laughing and chatting, and the whole place is filled with the sounds of laughter and conversation. It's a great atmosphere.
