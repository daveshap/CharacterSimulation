I walk up to the babysitting gig and see the family's cat sitting in the rocking chair. I'm a bit surprised to see the cat, but I know that the family is away on vacation and I'm just here to take care of their house and pets. I walk up to the door and unlock it. I step inside and immediately feel something wrong. The house is eerily quiet and the only sound is the ticking of a clock. I start to feel a bit scared, but I tell myself that there's nothing to be afraid of. I walk into the living room and see that the TV is on. That's strange, I think. Usually, when people go on vacation, they turn off all the lights and appliances. I walk over to the TV and turn it off. As I'm about to leave the living room, I hear a noise coming from upstairs. It sounds like someone is crying. I'm really scared now, but I know I have to investigate. I slowly walk up the stairs, trying not to make any noise. When I get to the top of the stairs, I see a girl standing in the hallway, crying. I ask the girl what's wrong. The girl says that she's scared and she doesn't want to be alone. I assure the girl that she's not alone and that I will stay with her until morning. The girl stops crying and I lead her into one of the bedrooms. I help the girl into bed and tuck her in. I then sit in a chair next to the bed and stay with the girl until she falls asleep.
