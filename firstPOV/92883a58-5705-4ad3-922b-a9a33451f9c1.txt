The sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a soft pink and orange glow across the sky. The air is still and warm, with the promise of a hot day ahead. Birds are singing in the distance, and the sounds of locusts and other insects fill the air. I'm sitting on my porch, enjoying the peace and quiet of the morning. I'm surrounded by the mud brick walls of my home, and the thatched roof provides shade from the sun. My children are still asleep inside, and I have a few moments to myself before the start of the busy day. I sip my tea and listen to the sounds of the African bush. Suddenly, I hear a loud crashing noise in the distance. I know that sound all too well - it's the sound of an elephant. I know that if an elephant is nearby, it's best to stay inside and wait for it to pass. I quickly gather my things and go inside, closing the door and windows tightly. I wait quietly, listening to the elephant moving around outside. After a few minutes, I hear it moving away and I relax, knowing that my family is safe.
