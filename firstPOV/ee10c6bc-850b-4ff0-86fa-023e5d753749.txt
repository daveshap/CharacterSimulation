I'm busy serving up drinks to the lunchtime crowd at the bar. It's a busy day and there's a lot of people about. The atmosphere is lively and there's a lot of chatter and laughter echoing around the room. I'm moving about quickly, passing drinks across the counter and picking up empties. I'm in my element here, enjoying the bustle and chatter of the bar.
