I'm enjoying my lunch in the airy, spacious cafeteria. The room is filled with light from the giant windows, and the colorful tables and chairs add a touch of levity to the otherwise sterile environment. I'm chatting with my fellow software engineers, joking and laughing about the latest code we're working on. We're all enjoying our break from the grind, but we all know we have to get back to work soon.
