I'm huddled up in a blanket, trying to stay warm. I've been up here for hours, waiting for the baby I'm supposed to be watching to finally go to bed. But the baby just won't go to sleep. I'm starting to get frustrated. I've tried everything - rocking the baby, singing to her, even walking her around the room - but nothing seems to work. I'm about to give up and go home when I finally hear the sound of the baby's cries subsiding. I look over and see that the baby has finally fallen asleep. Relieved, I put the baby down in her crib and head home, grateful that my long night is finally over.
