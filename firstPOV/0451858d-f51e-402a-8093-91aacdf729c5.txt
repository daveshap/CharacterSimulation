I enter the bedroom, placing a delivery on the bed. I look around the room, taking in the various pieces of furniture and decorations. I notice a photo of the customer on the bedside table and pause for a moment, looking at it. I then continue my delivery, placing the rest of the items in the room. I finish my delivery and prepare to leave, but pause when I see the customer's laptop on the bed. I look around the room again, and then decide to take the laptop with me.
