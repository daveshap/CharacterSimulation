The soft light of the morning sun filtered through the leaves of the trees, casting a dappled pattern on the ground below. I sat on a bench, my laptop open on my lap, absently scrolling through my Facebook feed as I waited for my train to arrive. I was wearing my usual work clothes - a well-pressed shirt and trousers - but I had foregone my usual heels in favor of a pair of comfortable flats. I had a cup of coffee in one hand and a croissant in the other, and I took occasional sips and bites as I scanned the screen. The sound of footsteps on the pavement interrupted my reverie, and I looked up to see a group of tourists approaching. They were chattering in a mix of French and English, and they stopped just in front of me, blocking my view of the tracks. I sighed and took another sip of coffee, trying to tune out their conversation. Suddenly, the ground shook beneath my feet and I heard a loud rumble. My heart leapt into my throat and I dropped my coffee cup, spilling the hot liquid onto my lap. The tourists screamed and ran in all directions, and I quickly gathered my things and stood up. The Eifel Tower was crumbling before my eyes, pieces of metal and stone raining down onto the ground. I stood frozen in shock, my eyes wide as I watched the destruction. Suddenly, a large piece of debris came hurtling towards me and I instinctively threw up my arms to protect my head. I felt a sharp pain as the debris hit me, and then everything went black.
