I'm sitting on a fallen tree in a dark forest in South America, eating my lunch. I'm surrounded by tall trees and foliage, and the only sound is the occasional bird call. The forest is eerily quiet and I feel a little uneasy. Suddenly, I hear a branch snap and I jump to my feet, heart pounding. I look around but don't see anything. I tell myself it was just an animal and sit back down, but I can't shake the feeling that someone is watching me.
