I arrived at the cottage a little before six to babysit for the night. The kids - a boy and a girl, ages six and eight - were excited to see me and immediately started asking me about the fun activities we were going to do that night. I settled them down with some dinner while I finished getting things ready for the night. I had planned to do some baking with the kids and then let them watch a movie before bed. The kids were excited to help with the baking and we had a lot of fun decorating the cookies. After the cookies were done, we settled in to watch our movie. I sat with them and watched the movie, but I was also secretly keeping an eye on the time. I wanted to make sure the kids were in bed at a decent hour so their parents wouldn't have to worry about them. The movie ended and I helped the kids get ready for bed. I read them a story and then tucked them in. The kids gave me a big hug and told me they had a lot of fun. I said goodnight and then went to clean up the kitchen. I finished up my chores and then settled down to watch some TV myself. It was going to be a long night, but I was happy to be spending it with the two kids.
