I was finishing up my shift at the grocery store when I heard a strange noise coming from the back of the store. I cautiously approached, trying to stay quiet, and peeks around the corner to see what's making the noise. To my horror, I saw a group of large, furry creatures rummaging through the store's food supply. They're giant rats! I was paralyzed with fear as I watched the rats devour everything in sight. I knew I should run, but I couldn't move. Suddenly, one of the rats noticed me and started to advance toward me, baring its sharp teeth. I knew I was about to become their next meal.
