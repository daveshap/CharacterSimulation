I stand at the edge of the cliff, gazing out at the breathtaking view. The sun hangs low in the sky, casting a golden glow over the mountaintops. A light breeze ruffles my hair, and I feel a sense of peace and calm wash over me. For a moment, I forget all my troubles back at home. I'm here on a school trip, and I've been looking forward to this day for weeks. I've never been to Europe before, and I'm excited to explore all the different countries. I know I'll never forget this trip, no matter what happens.
