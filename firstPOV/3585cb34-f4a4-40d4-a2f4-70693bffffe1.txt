I'm in my bedroom, at my desk. It's dusk, and the light is beginning to fade. I'm working on a school project, and I'm having trouble concentrating. I keep looking out the window at the trees and the sky, and I can hear the sound of the leaves rustling in the breeze. I'm getting restless, and I keep emailing my friend Sarah for help. Sarah is not responding, and I'm getting frustrated. I get up from my desk and go to the window. I open it and lean out, breathing in the fresh air. I look up at the sky and watch the clouds drift by. I feel a sense of peace and calm come over me, and I go back to my desk and finish my project.
