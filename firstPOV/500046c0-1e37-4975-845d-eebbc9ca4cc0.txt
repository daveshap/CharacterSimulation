I'm sitting on the mountaintop, enjoying the beautiful view. The sun is shining and the birds are singing, and it's the perfect place to relax. I've got a sandwich and a cold drink, and I'm feeling pretty good. I've been enjoying my time at home with my kids, but it's nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Everything is quiet and peaceful, until my phone rings. I look at it, and I see that it's my husband. I answer it, and he starts to tell me about his day. But I'm no longer interested in hearing about my husband's day. I'm more interested in the view from my mountaintop. I tell him I have to go, and I hang up the phone. Now I'm alone on the mountaintop, and I'm enjoying the peace and quiet.
