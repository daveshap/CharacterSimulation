The sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting a pink and orange glow across the sky. I stand on the top of a mountain, taking in the breathtaking view. I can see for miles in every direction, the valleys and rivers shimmering in the early morning light. I can even see the tiny villages and farms dotting the landscape. I'm here on a school trip, and I'm determined to make the most of it. I've already been up to the top of the mountain once, but I wanted to see the sunrise from here. It's something I've always wanted to do, and I know I'll never get another chance like this. So, here I am, standing on the top of a mountain in Europe, watching the sun come up. It's a moment I know I'll never forget.
