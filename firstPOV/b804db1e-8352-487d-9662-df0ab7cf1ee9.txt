The sun is setting over the mountaintop, and I'm one of the last skiers heading down the slopes. In the distance, the lights of the town are beginning to twinkle. I'm busy behind the bar, preparing for the evening rush. I've got bottles of beer chilling in the fridge and glasses lined up on the shelves. The jukebox is playing softly in the background. As the first customers begin to trickle in, I get busy serving them. I chat with them about their day on the slopes, and recommend some of my favorite beers. The bar starts to fill up, and I'm kept busy serving drinks and mingling with the guests. As the night goes on, the atmosphere in the bar gets more and more festive. I keep the drinks flowing, and the guests are having a great time. Towards closing time, things start to wind down and people begin to head home. I tidy up the bar, and then close up for the night.
