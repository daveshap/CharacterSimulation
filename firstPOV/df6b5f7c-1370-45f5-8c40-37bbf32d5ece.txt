I step out of the elevator onto the high-rise apartment's floor, and I'm met with a bustling city. The bright lights and busy crowd are a far cry from the quiet suburb I live in. I instantly feel out of place, but I know I have to be brave. It's my first night babysitting for the new family I've been assigned to. I take a deep breath and knock on the door. The mother greets me with a warm smile, and I instantly feel better. The kids are already in bed, but the mother tells me they may need help to fall asleep. I nod and go to tuck them in. I spend the next few hours reading to them and telling them stories. Eventually, they both drift off to sleep. I breathe a sigh of relief. I did it! The rest of the night is uneventful and I am able to relax and enjoy my time. I feel like I've made some new friends by the time I leave in the morning.
