I'm surrounded by other high schoolers, all cheering and clapping along to the music. We're at an outdoor concert, and the sun is just beginning to rise. The stage is lit up with spotlights, and the band is playing their hearts out. I'm having the time of my life, dancing and singing along to the music.
