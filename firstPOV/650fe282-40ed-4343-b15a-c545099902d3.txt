The sun was high in the sky, beating down on the sand and making it hot to the touch. I was watching my two charges, Lila and Timo, as they played in the water. I made sure to keep a close eye on them as I knew that the ocean could be dangerous. The sound of laughter filled the air as the two children played with each other, making sand castles and chasing each other around. I kept a smile on my face as I watched them, but I was also on alert in case they needed me. After a while, the children started to get hungry so I packed up their things and led them back to the beach house where we would have lunch.
