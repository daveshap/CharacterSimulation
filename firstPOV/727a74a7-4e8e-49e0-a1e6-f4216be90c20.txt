I'm in my bedroom, at the middle of the night. I'm lying on my bed, with my eyes wide open, looking at the ceiling. My mind is racing with thoughts and I'm feeling anxious. I'm thinking about my coffee shop and how it is doing. I'm worried about the bills and the competition. I'm also thinking about my personal life and how I'm single and loneliness. I'm feeling stressed and overwhelmed. Suddenly, I hear a noise outside my window. I get up to investigate and see a man climbing up the fire escape. The man is dressed in all black and is carrying a backpack. I'm about to call the police but decide to investigate myself. I quietly follow the man and see him break into the apartment next door. I know the people who live there are out of town and I don't want them to get burglarized. I decide to intervene. I quietly enter the apartment and surprise the burglar. The burglar panics and runs out the door. I decide to chase after him. I run down the stairs and out the front door. I see the burglar running down the street and decide to follow him. I'm running as fast as I can but the burglar is getting away. Suddenly, the burglar trips and falls. I catch up to him and tackle him to the ground. I tie him up with my belt and call the police. When the police arrive, they arrest the burglar and take him away. I'm a hero!
