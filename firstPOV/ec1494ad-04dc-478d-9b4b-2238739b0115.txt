I'm working on a construction site in the city. It's a hot day and I'm sweating from the heat and the physical labor. I take a break to wipe the sweat from my brow and take a drink of water. I look up at the skyline and marvel at the tall buildings. I've never been to the city before and I'm impressed by the sights.
