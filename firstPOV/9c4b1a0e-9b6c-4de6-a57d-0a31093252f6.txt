I'm Mashawn, a construction worker, and I'm working on a mountaintop in Europe. It's the middle of the night, and I'm using a large machine to excavate the mountain. I'm wearing a hard hat and have a large tool belt around my waist. I'm sweating profusely, and the noise from the machine is deafening. I'm surrounded by a small team of workers who are helping me operate the machine.
