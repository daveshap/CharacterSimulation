I can feel the presence of something following me as I walk through the forest. I quicken my pace, but the rustling in the bushes only gets louder. Suddenly, a jaguar springs out in front of me, blocking my path. My heart races as I back away slowly. The jaguar is stalking me, ready to pounce. I know I'm not going to make it out of the forest alive.
