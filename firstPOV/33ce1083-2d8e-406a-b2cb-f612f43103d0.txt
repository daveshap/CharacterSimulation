I was Millie and John's babysitter. I was in high school and had just turned 17. It was a Saturday night and I had been babysitting the kids since six o'clock. The kids were in bed and asleep and I was in the living room watching TV. It was now midnight and I was getting sleepy. I was just about to turn off the TV and go upstairs to bed when I heard a noise coming from the kitchen. I got up from the couch and slowly made my way to the kitchen. When I got to the kitchen, I saw that the back door was open and the screen door was swinging back and forth. I knew that Millie and John never left the doors open like that. I also knew that the kids were asleep upstairs and I would have to go check on them. I went to the back door and closed it. I then went to the stairs and started to climb them. When I got to the top of the stairs, I heard a noise coming from the room that the kids were in. I slowly made my way to the room and when I got there, I saw that the window was open. I went to the window and closed it. Then I went to the kids and made sure they were okay. After I checked on the kids, I went back downstairs and called the police. The police came and they searched the house. They didn't find anything, but they did take a report. I was relieved that nothing had happened to the kids. I was also glad that I had called the police when I did.
