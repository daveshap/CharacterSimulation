I was taking a break from work and decided to have a quick bite in my bedroom. I sat on my bed with a sandwich in hand and turned on the TV. I started flipping through the channels, stopping on a news channel. After a few minutes, I got up and turned off the TV. I went to my dresser and took out an envelope. I sat back on the bed and looked at the envelope.
