The sun is shining and the birds are singing. I'm sitting at a table on the porch of my country cottage, enjoying a leisurely lunch. I've got a sandwich and a glass of lemonade, and I'm feeling pretty good about life. It's a beautiful day, and I'm surrounded by the peace and quiet of the countryside.
