I am Swathi, a software engineer, and I am currently working on a project in Africa. It is the middle of the night, and I am sitting in my tent, working on my laptop. I am surrounded by the sounds of the African wilderness - the calls of the animals, the rustling of the leaves in the breeze. I am wearing a pair of shorts and a T-shirt, and my hair is pulled back in a ponytail. I am concentrating on my work, typing away at my laptop. Every so often, I stop to check my phone, which is sitting on the table next to me.
